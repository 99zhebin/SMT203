Could be more than 61%.

A lot of opposition are well off, own two or three apartments which they rented out to Indians.  We should not think that opposition are low ses peasants who are suffering, hence why they are camping here 24/7.

Now I think we need to be clear about what people mean by saying that they hate ceca.

From what I gathered, it is not the Agreement that they hate because most did not even read up what it was about.   Not at all.

 When they said they hate ceca, they are saying that they don't like Indians.  And very often, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are also mistaken for Indians even though the CECA was not signed with their countries but India.

 Plus the few hundred thousand construction workers and road workers whose natures of job make them highly visible gave the impression that we have lots of Indians.  So, when you have just 50 Indian professionals eating lunch together, people say wow! so many Indians!   But when you have 50 Chinese eating mala at a food court, nobody notices and even if he notices, he does not have a strong reaction to it  because...same skin colour.  

In fact, we have far more Malaysians and Chinese working here than Indians.

Yes and no.

At EP level. Say you pay a Ceca or other Foreign Trash $4000.

For that salary you are getting somebody with some years of experience. He comes here and could already do the job with minimal training. 

For $4000 on a singaporean, it's likely to be just fresh grad and waiting to be spoonfed.

EP/SP also less likely to jump around as much as a singaporean. singaporean can decide to quit today if not happy and just sit at home and live on parents for months.

EP/SP don't have such luxury. And also they have to go through the employment pass paperwork hassle if they change jobs, so they tend to stay longer also. 

So when employers employ EP/SP, it's often not just about costs. It's alot of other factors like those mentioned above.

But having said that, now employers are getting used to the idea of remote workers.....

Do you even realize the number of dependents they bring in? Malaysians, Chinese and white people don't bring in their whole family including their parents, brothers and sisters.

As I have already mentioned before and which you seemingly ignored, the point of contention is also that india's interpretation of the agreement is one of no limits or quotas when it comes to movement of their people. This is especially problematic and MIW has not been clear on their stance regarding it. Tell me, which other country has done the same(ie demand unlimited flow) to us as well? We have multiple FTAs, but I think only one other one(if at all) actually guarantees allowing dependents to work. Why did we give such a major concession? Importing workers is already a contentious enough issue, still want to guarantee their dependents the right to work as well and add on to the already intensive competition? Unlimited flow + dependents, doesn't take a fortune teller to see where this will lead to if we accede to india's interpretation of the agreement.

That so many of india's companies were placed on the whatchlist in the first place indicated problematic hiring practices. They were subsequently taken off the whatchlist immediately after the second round of ceca negotiations. Why were they taken off the list? Did they rectify the issue or did we give in to pressure from them? The lack of transparency coupled with india's intentions is what makes me uncomfortable with the whole thing. My impression is that they are using the agreement to try and secure more jobs for their people here, be it directly through the agreement or via conventional routes. Other countries work to secure jobs for their people back home, they reverse and strive to secure jobs for their people in other countries instead because not many companies are interested in going to india to set up shop.

This issues will continue to persist as long as the ambiguity in definition is not settled once and for all.

They may not be aware of the treaty itself but they are well aware of the effects of it. One being that more ceca have landed here to take up high profile jobs in areas such as finance which singaporeans in general desire. Just have to look at the 100+ list of professions that ceca have access to here. That is why their presence is more keenly felt even if their numbers aren't as large as from other countries. Nowadays, I come across more cecas in IT and finance than I do Chinamen. Conversely, I come across far far far more Chinamen in factories than I do cecas. If there ever comes a time when singaporeans have no interest in areas such as finance, then their attention will turn away from the cecas to whichever nationality(at that time) is taking up more of the new in demand jobs. Eg If we suddenly grew interest in manufacturing/production line then jhk and Chinamen will irk us even more than the cecas. It's why not many complained about foreigners(not even cecas) in the biotech industry because not many singaporeans interested in it.

Well, from what I read, finance is an area which has a lot of jhks, not cecas.  Recently, I read a few posts here...cannot remember which thread, so please do not ask me to quote....saying that there are a lot of jhks working in the Big Four.

Finance (and accounts) I believe would not be an area where a lot of Chinamen can easily enter because the accounting system in China is vastly different from ours which is British based.   But one thing is quite universal and that is western medicine, and there are a lot of Chinamen who work as doctors and nurses in our hospitals and that I know very well.

Having said that, most cecas are in IT and banking.  The common gripe is: are there no singaporeans who can do those jobs?  The short and simple answer is, sorry to admit it, we do have but not enough.  It is very easy to be carried away thinking that we know a lot about IT and banking after graduating with a degree and having 3 or 4 years of working experience. In truth, Singaporeans...or the vast majority...are still lagging behind international standards.  I know that by saying this, I am going to offend some people here, but it's the hard truth.  I cannot say otherwise.",, i really like the way you wrote  you do discuss converse and that makes forumming so enjoyable  we can agree sometimes some things we will disagree but there is no need for name calling and insults and personal attacks which some members threw at me  well from what i read finance is an area which has a lot of jhks not cecas  recently i read a few posts herecannot remember which thread so please do not ask me to quotesaying that there are a lot of jhks working in the big four  finance and accounts i believe would not be an area where a lot of chinamen can easily enter because the accounting system in china is vastly different from ours which is british based   but one thing is quite universal and that is western medicine and there are a lot of chinamen who work as doctors and nurses in our hospitals and that i know very well  having said that most cecas are in it and banking  the common gripe is are there no singaporeans who can do those jobs  the short and simple answer is sorry to admit it we do have but not enough  it is very easy to be carried away thinking that we know a lot about it and banking after graduating with a degree and having  or  years of working experience in truth singaporeansor the vast majorityare still lagging behind international standards  i know that by saying this i am going to offend some people here but it is the hard truth  i cannot say otherwise,really like way wrote discuss converse makes forumming enjoyable agree sometimes things disagree need name calling insults personal attacks members threw well read finance area lot jhks cecas recently read posts herecannot remember thread please ask quotesaying lot jhks working big four finance accounts believe would area lot chinamen easily enter accounting system china vastly different british based one thing quite universal western medicine lot chinamen work doctors nurses hospitals know well said cecas banking common gripe singaporeans jobs short simple answer sorry admit enough easy carried away thinking know lot banking graduating degree years working experience truth singaporeansor vast majorityare still lagging behind international standards know saying going offend people hard truth cannot say otherwise,really like way wrote discuss converse makes forumming enjoyable agree sometimes things disagree need name calling insults personal attacks members threw well read finance area lot jhks s recently read posts herecannot remember thread please ask quotesaying lot jhks working big four finance accounts believe would area lot chinamen easily enter accounting system china vastly different british based one thing quite universal western medicine lot chinamen work doctors nurses hospitals know well said s banking common gripe singaporeans jobs short simple answer sorry admit enough easy carried away thinking know lot banking graduating degree years working experience truth singaporeansor vast majorityare still lagging behind international standards know saying going offend people hard truth cannot say otherwise,Positive

Yes, there are plenty of jhk in accounting but mostly low level. That's to say, spass and work permit. Things such as bookkeeping and ar/ap. CECA on the other hand are mostly here for EP hence my reason for their presence being felt more than other groups when it comes to job competition in those areas.

As for doctors, I would say just as many cecas as Chinamen. For example, IMH psychiatrists. You can see plenty of those with mbbs from india but none from China.

As for not having enough people. It's a fact that singapore will never have enough of anything. Hell, no country, not even the bee kok and the Chinamen, will ever have enough of anything. The question is, where do we draw the line and say ""enough is enough, we don't need more and are happy with what we have now""? I'm sure most singaporeans don't want to keep running the gdp hamster wheel which is why they soundly reject the idea of sg having 6.9m/10m. That's to say, they don't mind losing out in some areas if it means a slower pace of life and less competition. This plays into the larger quest for work-life balance. The larger the population grows, the greater the friction and competition, the more such fault lines will be magnified. The swiss don't exactly have a very large population(relative to land mass) but they are often ranked the highest in the world despite being far more relaxed than us(they don't have a facination with gdp or ""meritocracy""). Woody always quoting the swiss but failing to understand what makes them tick.

These foreign students grades are top in our cohorts, so it's a form of accreditation. Spoke with them and they say that they have completed their university studies in Myanmar and got degree liao.

The Government retains full rights to decide who can enter the country to live, work or become permanent residents (PRs) or citizens, he told the House on Tuesday (July 6).

Debunking falsehoods about the free trade pact, which has come under fire on social media and by the opposition, he stressed: ""I emphasise and underline and highlight this: Nothing in the agreement implies Singapore must unconditionally let in professionals, managers, and executives (PMEs) from India.


""Contrary to the Progress Singapore Party's (PSP) claim, our ability to impose requirements for immigration and work pass, has never been in question in Ceca or any other free trade agreement (FTA) that we have signed.""

Mr Ong's ministerial statement came of the heels of Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam calling on the PSP to file a motion on FTAs and Ceca in Parliament at the previous sitting in May.

PSP Non-constituency MP Leong Mun Wai, in a Facebook post on June 22, wrote: ""The most important economic policies that have affected the jobs and livelihoods of Singaporeans relate to Foreign PMETs and Free Trade Agreements, in particular the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) with India.""

ceca-does-not-allow-unconditional-entry-of-indian-professionals-into-spore-ong-ye-kung.6550104/page-2,jonesftw,"In a Ministerial Statement on Tuesday (July 6), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung - formerly the deputy chief negotiator for the US-Singapore FTA - and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng debunked misconceptions about the Singapore-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca).

The free trade pact, which was inked in 2005, has come under attack from some quarters on social media as well as during last year's general election.

Here are five myths and facts about Ceca, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry:

MYTH 1: Ceca obliges Singapore to give Indian workers free entry into Singapore

FACT: Ceca does not give Indian nationals unfettered access to Singapore's labour market.

All foreign nationals, including Indian professionals and intra-corporate transferees (ICTs), have to meet prevailing work pass criteria before they are allowed to work in Singapore.

ICTs refer to transfers of a company's employees from one country to another. They have consistently constituted a very small number - about 4,200 in 2020, of which 500 were from India.

Some have noted that companies which bring ICTs in do not have to advertise the position to locals as part of the Fair Consideration Framework, which requires employers to advertise jobs on the MyCareersFuture.sg portal before submitting Employment Pass (EP) and S Pass applications.

But overseas ICTs must fulfil additional criteria in order to meet the definition of ICTs in Singapore's FTAs, including a minimum duration of working for the employer outside of Singapore.

They are also subject to conditions on their eligibility to bring in dependants, apply for permanent residency or future employment in Singapore.

For example, under Ceca, such transferees must have worked at least six months in the parent company, among other requirements. They can stay in Singapore for a total term of eight years, at most.

MYTH 2: Ceca gives Indian nationals privileges for citizenship or permanent residency

FACT: Nothing in Ceca affects Singapore's right to regulate immigration, citizenship or permanent residency.

Chapter 9 of the agreement on movement of natural persons makes it clear that the Government's ability to regulate immigration and foreign manpower is not affected by the agreement.

Article 9.1.2 explicitly states that Ceca ""shall not apply to measures pertaining to citizenship, permanent residence, or employment on a permanent basis"".

MYTH 3: Ceca obliges Singapore to allow the entry of Indian dependants and for them to work in Singapore

FACT: All work pass holders need to meet the Manpower Ministry's prevailing criteria to bring in dependants.

The vast majority of dependants are in Singapore to accompany the work pass holder and do not work during their stay in Singapore. Those who wish to work have to apply for a relevant work pass.

Since May 1 this year, foreigners staying in Singapore on dependant's passes need a work pass in order to work here, instead of a letter of consent.

This means their employers need to apply for an EP, S Pass or work permit for them, and the relevant qualifying salary, dependency ratio ceiling and levy apply.

MYTH 4: There is a separate category of ""professional visas"" for the 127 professions listed in Annex 9A of Ceca

FACT: There is no such separate category. They are subjected to the same prevailing work pass criteria that MOM apeopleies to all other foreigners.

A whatlar listing of professions is contained in India's FTAs with a few other countries.

India's Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with South Korea has 163 professions in its annex to the chapter on movement of natural persons.

Its agreement with Japan also contains an appendix with professions ranging from computer services, to management consulting.

There is even a separate provision for the temporary stay of Indians in Japan who teach Indian yoga, cuisine, classical music and dance.

MYTH 5 : The nationality profile of Singapore's foreign workforce has been influenced by Ceca

FACT: The nationality composition of Singapore's workforce is an outcome of the sectors it has chosen to focus on, as well as global demand and supeopley of workers with the relevant skill sets.

These workers are competitive in certain sectors, and from certain countries of origin.

As Singapore does not have enough locals to fill these jobs, Indian tech talents have come to Singapore through the work pass framework to complement local tech talent.

The growth of the digital economy in turn creates good jobs for Singaporeans.

i am glad that even you agreed even with CECA , all indian professional has to go through the work permit process. It is a equal treatment to all professional who want to work in Singapore.
That is something PSP has not take a position yet. If you want to know, PSP Dr Tan did said something on the free movement on CECA during his opening speech of PSP somewhere in August 2019.

SO CECA is not the PROBLEM here. PSP is barking on the wrong issue. Lets get it right and focus on the right subject.

So every professional from all over the world who want to work in Singapore need to get through MOM for WP,SP or EP (includes ICT). 

Now you has stated :
1) And you are saying that MOM approve the WP/SP/EP easier due to CECA. It is not truth. Which clause officially stated that?

That's a bunch of bollocks

I did not say anything about agreeing with every bit of ceca. You are just putting words into my mouth.

CECA is the problem here insofar as india's interpretation of the agreement being one of ""no limits/quota"" in regard to movement of their people and how they are trying to pressure us into allowing more of their people here. There is also the issue of them being allowed to bring in their dependents who are in turn granted rights to work as per the agreement.

As for your questions:

1)Do you even know what ceca or any fta is about? It is to facilitate trade and services as well as movement of people. Do you understand the meaning of ""facilitate""? It is to make it easier. Just how much easier is the point of contention.

2)Where were you the past few years? You didn't read the news about india complaining about us restricting their flow of people? Not forgetting as well that HSK just recently admitted that india does use pressure tactics on us to try and push for us to allow more of their people here.

So my challenge to you is which clause in CECA that say that ? no limits/quota of movement of their people

FTAs are legally binding international treaties between two or more trading partners that seek to promote trade by reducing barriers to trade in goods, services and investments.

My challenge to you IS FOR YOU TO READ WHAT I SAID. Did I say there is a clause stating so? I'm saying that india's interpretation of the agreement is one of no limits/quota. You should go ASK THEM instead because they were the ones who complained as such.

As for FTAs. I can't believe the bollocks you wrote. Movement of people is one of the main parts of the agreement. Even your MIW said so themselves because they compared it to other agreements as well.

""IT DOES RESTRICT THE MOEVEMENT OF PEOPLE MORE THAN ENCOURAGE IT""

I don't know whether to laugh or cry. It shows that you do not understand what a FTA is about. Please do explain how it ""restricts movement"" when clauses in the agreement specifically refer to things such as expediting work pass applications as well as providing various access routes?

I'm not unhappy with them complaning per se. I'm unhappy with MIW not giving any concrete response to it which makes me suspect that they have given in to their demands. That the composition of ceca EPs has increased to 1/4 may be a sign of it.

Can you refer me to that interpretation you talked about? without it, there is no basis to say no limits/quota.

Quoted from today Ministerial Statement
""In some sensitive areas, it is easy to negotiate exceptions or carve-outs because everyone agrees. One example is right of taxation by governments. Another one is national security. The third one is immigration.

Every country holds the view that there cannot be unfettered movement of people across borders. Every FTA partner believes that. That would create social unrest and a big public uproar. Governments must retain the ability to impose immigration and border controls, and FTAs cannot undermine that.

Hence, in all FTAs and also WTO agreements, you will find that immigration powers are strongly and prominently preserved and protected. You can find such standard clauses in the WTO Agreement as well as in all our FTAs, including CECA.""

India has put on hold a review of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) in response to cutbacks in visa approvals for Indian software professionals bound for Singapore, according to a report in the Times of India newspaper.. Read more at straitstimes.com.


                        the Singapore authorities were insisting on an ""economic needs test"" (ENT), which requires compliance with certain economic criteria, to deny access to Indian professionals.

As for the rest of your post. What are responding to? The part where you said that FTA ""restricts movement instead of encourages it""?

If so, then you have misread it. Nowhere does it state that FTAs are out to discourage movement of people. It just means that it has to be within reason. It did not say anything about FTAs being designed to restrict movement. The fundamental basis of a FTA is to facilitate movement of people(for the purpose of work) as well as trade.

I did not say the agreement is as such, sg governmentt supposedly didn't say either(or at least I hope they didn't but they might have overpromised or mislead the other party) it but india side expected it to be so, hence the complaint.

And my main point is that CECA WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE if the ambiguity in interpretation of the agreement is not settled once and for all. They threatened us with it before, they can do so again. Use some common sense also. If the FTA wasn't the issue then why did india specifically complain about us violating it? Saying that they have to go through applying for work pass is meaningless because there is the perception that we are giving out more passes than we should due to possible diplomatic pressure(by using the agreement as leverage) from india side. The ministries don't work in a vacuum, they take orders from the governmentt which is not immune to diplomatic pressure.

Also, you misread the whole thing but still can tell me that ""at least I understood""? You make ridiculous claims like ""FTA IS TO RESTRICT MOVEMENT MORE THAN ENCOURAGE IT""....you have no business lecturing me on what I ""at least understood"" when you don't even understand most of it yourself or even the things I said, not especially when the first thing you did was to come out and put words into my mouth. If you even read the FTA, the very title of chpt 9(movement of natural persons) would have clued you in and you would not have made such a claim. You relied solely on the minister's statement but you couldn't even get it right.

So even without CECA , they still can come to apply jobs in Singapore? no?
EP holders in Singapore is 177k in 2020. Out of those, 4.2k is under ICT. And out of 4.2k, 500 is from India via CECA.

So with CECA, u get in 500 ICTs extra. Is that alot? IMO, it is not.

But what i am interested is ... can we direct more jobs to be given to skilled & displaced Singaporeans before they consider EP?
Is the current policy of having the job on mycareerfuture for 28days working as it is?

Perhaps on PSP position. They are still not clear.

Quote from CNA
Ã¢ÂÂAfter hearing all the explanation from Dr Tan and I, will you agree to the following? First, the FTAs, including CECA, are fundamental to Singapore's economic survival, and our ability to earn a living and we should not shake this bedrock for political purposes.

Ã¢ÂÂSecond, CECA does not allow a free flow of Indian PMEs into Singapore, and this is a gross misunderstanding of the agreement and FTAs in general. Nor is CECA the cause of the challenges faced by our PMEs, and we put a stop to the spreading of the falsehoods.Ã¢ÂÂ
-------
""In response to Mr Ong, Mr Leong said that the PSP supports FTAs and are Ã¢ÂÂreassuredÃ¢ÂÂ that SingaporeansÃ¢ÂÂ interests are Ã¢ÂÂtaken care ofÃ¢ÂÂ. But he said that they have more questions on whether CECA has contributed to the Ã¢ÂÂoverall influxÃ¢ÂÂ of Indian workers before they can conclude whether CECA is Ã¢ÂÂreally neutral to beneficial for SingaporeÃ¢ÂÂ.

When Mr Ong summarised PSPÃ¢ÂÂs position by saying that PSP Ã¢ÂÂwill take back the allegations that CECA has led to an unfettered flow of Indian professionals into SingaporeÃ¢ÂÂ, Mr Leong objected.

Ã¢ÂÂAs to whether CECA has contributed to the influx of some of the PMETs in Singapore in relation to our overall foreign talent policy, we have to explore that. And we don't agree that CECA is net beneficial to Singapore at this stage,Ã¢ÂÂ he insisted.""

Why do you continue to peddle such a lie? It shows your lack of knowledge.

Do you know what services consist of? It consists of people moving from one country to another to work as well.

As per the wto:






                                                WTO | Services: Movement of natural persons
                                        

This TRADE TOPICS page will take you to information available on the WTO website, on issues handled by the WTOs councils and committees, and its trade agreements


                                




They are even working towards improving access for natural person:




                        Various members, and developing countries in particular, have put significant emphasis on securing better commitments on the temporary movement of natural persons
                






                        A number of the offers submitted in the current negotiations propose upgrading access for natural persons.

That shows that the intent of FTAs in general is also to liberalize the movement of manpower from one country to another. They may not explicitly state ""manpower"" but it is covered under services. You supposedly read up on the whole thing but never notice?

Regarding to your LMIA, i can only say it is up for debate. In my view, we have Fair Consideration Framework ( FCF ) .  
The Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) sets out requirements for all employers in Singapore to consider the workforce in Singapore fairly for job opportunities.

Does it serve the main objectives? Is it effective ? That is again up for debate.

Regarding your question on rise of foreign employment, every country face different problems due to difference in culture, race ,economy etc.

So which other countries in the global economy also experienced the same extent in the rise of foreign employment by Singapore over 2005 to 2021 especially from India that led to:

1. The select takeover of IT/financial sectors and rise of economic enclaves (CBP, MBFC). Was India ever a financial powerhouse?

2. Not only anecdotal discrimination against citizens at the workplace, but the kind of well established and documented systemic discrimination that has necessitated public/administrative intervention?

you just sidestepped my point with something that is not related. I took to task YOUR CLAIM THAT FTAs ARE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO RESTRICT MOVEMENT RATHER THAN ENCOURAGE IT. I showed you the evidence otherwise and now in an effort to hide your embarrrassment, you bring in something else. You want others to admit their own mistakes but you can't even admit your own.

By the way, Tharman only say wrong to have total free flow. He didn't say we should make it more difficult. In order words, he is saying that we should liberalize (by breaking down more of current barriers) the flow of people but not to the point that there are no barriers at all. He did not say anything about FTAs being DESIGNED TO RESTRICT MOVEMENT.

And as I have asked you before. FTA only one country sign ah? We can do what we want and ignore the other side without repercussions? Who does MOM answer to? The minister. And what is the minister part of? The government. And who can exert pressure on our governmentt? india.

It's just like the white man bank robber case. The UK exerted pressure on us by demanding that we do not cane him if they extradite him. We agreed and he was brought back here to be sentenced. Going by your logic, MHA can still insist on caning him because our laws requires it and the UK won't take us to task for it?

1 ) First, you need to know the definition of a natural human in FTAs. 
They are relates to Intra-companies transfer and business visitor which is essential if you setup a branch.

""In the Uruguay Round, commitments scheduled under Mode 4 were largely limited to two categories: intra-company transferees regarded as Ã¢ÂÂessential personnelÃ¢ÂÂ, such as managers and technical staff linked with a commercial presence in the host country; and business visitors, i.e. short-term visitors not in general gainfully employed in the host country.""

2) In regards when i mean restrict movement. I refer to seeking employment. End of the day, main issue is trade but you need some personal to help you with trade. Thats why FTAs has to grant such ICTs and business visitor in. It does not means allow free movement of employment. Thats what i am trying to say.

 I refer you to Item 4
""4. The Agreement shall not prevent a Member from applying measures to regulate the entry of natural persons into, or their temporary stay in, its territory, including those measures necessary to protect the integrity of, and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across, its borders, provided that such measures are not apeopleied in such a manner as to nullify or impair the benefits accruing to any Member under the terms of a specific commitment.""

And how do those definitions change anything? It is STILL MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE COMING TO WORK. That shows that the facilitation of people for work is being encouraged by such agreements, not to restrict. The only difference is that those coming through the agreement have a DEFINITE (ie cannot renew) time limit to their work passes while those who come through the normal route can renew indefinitely.

Now you flip around. Post 20 post saying the SAME THING (ie restrict movement of manpower) but now change your tune? You obviously didn't know what you were talking about from the beggining. Only when I start showing more things then you shift here and there. By the way, the agreement does not restrict ALL EMPLOYMENT EITHER. It just does not apply to PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT only like I explained in the previous paragraph. Temporary employment is still encouraged and facilitated via the various routes. For example, a ceca IT company here can bring in a ceca technician from another ceca company because such a person qualifies as a ""Member who are employed by a service supeopleier of a Member, in respect of the supeopley of a service"". Do note also that there is no stated limit for the number of temporary natural persons so in theory, they can request as many as they like to come over. So when one goes home, they can bring in another to replace and the cycle continues.

You know you are not the best person to explain yet you can go around telling others to go READ UP when YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO YOURSELF. If you can't explain well, then why are you trying to lecture others? Still can sigh at others some more.

You did change your tune. It's funny you accused PSP of not being honest by not willing to admit yet you are being less than honest yourself. Your own conscience, you answer to it.

You like to use the excuse of ""not explaining better"" then why do you KEEP TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO OTHERS AND LECTURE THEM? You SIGH at us, WE SIGH AT YOUR ATROCIOUS ENGLAND. Stop trying to explain to others then.

And as I have already explained, the government could have approved them to come in via normal route (that's why 25% ep is ceca) instead of ICT to appease india. It is the same effect at the end of the day because what india essentially wants is for THEIR PEOPLE (pmets) TO COME HERE TO WORK. That's the PRICE they want for signing the agreement. Whether you put them under ICT, or normal EP they don't really care because their objective of having their people here is fulfilled. That's like transferring from left pocket to right pocket on the same pair of plants.

ICT is to come here and do work. Normal EP is also to come here and do work. Both same effect. There is nothing stopping ICT from applying under normal EP to come here.  They will still be working for the same company only that they are classified under EP instead of ICT.

If you ask me that question, obviously you didn't read my explanation properly. Are you a foreigner? It's like you have a hard time communicating with singaporeans.

I said instead of approving under ICT, the government could have approved under normal EP to FULFILL OUR PART OF THE AGREEMENT. It is just a different label but india is still pleased because it still means that their people are coming here to work. That's to say, rather than apply under ICT, we are now asking them to apply under EP route but we are still approving them in consideration of the agreement. That's why I don't view the 25% as a mere coincidence.

You have to understand the motive of india. They want their many of their PMETS to come here to work. That is no secret, Even HSK admitted so. That's what they want in exchange for the agreement. Whether they come as ICT or EP does not matter to them because both also RESULT IN THEIR PMET COMING HERE TO WORK. SAME EFFECT BUT DIFFERENT TITLE/LABLE.

Happiest Minds, which has its U.S. headquarters in San Jose, is accused of using visas and discriminatory practices to fill its ranks with South Asian workers.



San Jose tech firm discriminated against non-Indians, favored visa holders, lawsuit claims


Sulzberg claimed in the suit that she had been the only non-Indian among the approximately 25 salsepeople in Happiest MindsÃ¢ÂÂ U.S. offices. Her purported troubles started during a sales meeting about six weeks after she started at the firm, the suit claimed.

Ã¢ÂÂMs. Sulzberg was the only female employee at the meeting and the only individual who was non-South Asian and non-Indian,Ã¢ÂÂ the suit alleged. Ã¢ÂÂMs. Sulzberg was excluded by her South Asian colleagues who spoke in Hindi, thereby precluding her from participating in certain conversations, and was specifically asked not to attend the first portion
of the meeting involving the whole group.Ã¢ÂÂ

During her presentation at the meeting, which was supposed to last an hour, the firmÃ¢ÂÂs South Asian CEO rudely interrupted her, saying he didnÃ¢ÂÂt want to look at her PowerPoint and telling her, Ã¢ÂÂMove on, move on,Ã¢ÂÂ before cutting her off after 10 minutes, the suit claimed. The CEO also asked her to book him a hotel room for an upcoming meeting Ã¢ÂÂdespite the fact that Ms. SulzbergÃ¢ÂÂs sales role did not involve such administrative or secretarial responsibilities,Ã¢ÂÂ the suit alleged.

The following month, after receiving approval from a senior vice-president to attend a conference in Las Vegas to pursue sales, Sulzberg was told by that executive that the CEO didnÃ¢ÂÂt want her to go, the suit claimed. However, an Indian employee was permitted to attend, the suit alleged.",,                                                         san jose tech firm discriminated against nonindians favored visa holders lawsuit claims                                           happiest minds which has its us headquarters in san jose is accused of using visas and discriminatory practices to fill its ranks with south asian workers    san jose tech firm discriminated against nonindians favored visa holders lawsuit claims   sulzberg claimed in the suit that she had been the only nonindian among the approximately  salsepeople in happiest mindsÃ¢   us offices her purported troubles started during a sales meeting about six weeks after she started at the firm the suit claimed  Ã¢  ms sulzberg was the only female employee at the meeting and the only individual who was nonsouth asian and nonindianÃ¢   the suit alleged Ã¢  ms sulzberg was excluded by her south asian colleagues who spoke in hindi thereby precluding her from participating in certain conversations and was specifically asked not to attend the first portion of the meeting involving the whole groupÃ¢    during her presentation at the meeting which was supposed to last an hour the firmÃ¢  s south asian ceo rudely interrupted her saying he didnÃ¢  t want to look at her powerpoint and telling her Ã¢  move on move onÃ¢   before cutting her off after  minutes the suit claimed the ceo also asked her to book him a hotel room for an upcoming meeting Ã¢  despite the fact that ms sulzbergÃ¢  s sales role did not involve such administrative or secretarial responsibilitiesÃ¢   the suit alleged  the following month after receiving approval from a senior vicepresident to attend a conference in las vegas to pursue sales sulzberg was told by that executive that the ceo didnÃ¢  t want her to go the suit claimed however an indian employee was permitted to attend the suit alleged,san jose tech firm discriminated nonindians favored visa holders lawsuit claims happiest minds us headquarters san jose accused using visas discriminatory practices fill ranks south asian workers san jose tech firm discriminated nonindians favored visa holders lawsuit claims sulzberg claimed suit nonindian among approximately salsepeople happiest mindsÃ¢ us offices purported troubles started sales meeting six weeks started firm suit claimed Ã¢ ms sulzberg female employee meeting individual nonsouth asian nonindianÃ¢ suit alleged Ã¢ ms sulzberg excluded south asian colleagues spoke hindi thereby precluding participating certain conversations specifically asked attend first portion meeting involving whole groupÃ¢ presentation meeting supposed last hour firmÃ¢ south asian ceo rudely interrupted saying didnÃ¢ want look powerpoint telling Ã¢ move move onÃ¢ cutting minutes suit claimed ceo also asked book hotel room upcoming meeting Ã¢ despite fact ms sulzbergÃ¢ sales role involve administrative secretarial responsibilitiesÃ¢ suit alleged following month receiving approval senior vicepresident attend conference las vegas pursue sales sulzberg told executive ceo didnÃ¢ want go suit claimed however indian employee permitted attend suit alleged,san jose tech firm discriminated nonindians favored visa holders lawsuit claims happiest minds us headquarters san jose accused using visas discriminatory practices fill ranks south asian workers san jose tech firm discriminated nonindians favored visa holders lawsuit claims sulzberg claimed suit nonindian among approximately salsepeople happiest mindsÃ¢ us offices purported troubles started sales meeting six weeks started firm suit claimed Ã¢ ms sulzberg female employee meeting individual nonsouth asian nonindianÃ¢ suit alleged Ã¢ ms sulzberg excluded south asian colleagues spoke hindi thereby precluding participating certain conversations specifically asked attend first portion meeting involving whole groupÃ¢ presentation meeting supposed last hour firmÃ¢ south asian ceo rudely interrupted saying didnÃ¢ want look powerpoint telling Ã¢ move move onÃ¢ cutting minutes suit claimed ceo also asked book hotel room upcoming meeting Ã¢ despite fact ms sulzbergÃ¢ sales role involve administrative secretarial responsibilitiesÃ¢ suit alleged following month receiving approval senior vicepresident attend conference las vegas pursue sales sulzberg told executive ceo didnÃ¢ want go suit claimed however indian employee permitted attend suit alleged,Neutral

It seems you have an issue trying to see the overall picture of what I'm saying.

Remember what I said about india's interpretation earlier on? Even though it is not under ICT, they still view it as being the same in effect because at the end of the day, they want their PMETs to be here to work. Whether they come in under ICT or normal EP doesn't matter so long as their pmet come here to work.

So if we restrict their EP numbers, they will very likely become angry and complain AGAIN about us restricting their numbers because they already have a hard time trying to come in under ICT.

I give you an analogy. You have $1 on you. You put it in your left pocket first then transfer it to your right pocket, how much do you have left? Still $1 right? Does the $1 being in the left or right pocket matter? Same thing for employment. A ceca under ICT is the same in effect as a ceca with normal ep because both mean +1 ceca (ie from that country) working here.

Do you know as well that those who get rejected for ICT are encouraged to try under normal EP instead? And that's what those ceca companies did.

You are concern about PMETs from India because it is a fact that over the year their number has increased.

25% of 177k EP is about 43k EP from India. 
And 500 out of 43k is coming from ICTs.

My point is if those are coming from EP route , then the control point is MOM not CECA.

I wont believe that because of India's interpretation of CECA and its diplomatic pressure on Singapore ,it will result in MOM relaxing its rules.

You willing to have blind faith and trust, I don't. That's why I questioned. Like in an earlier article I quoted, they already took off their companies from the FCF whatchlist without any explanation.

What I'm trying to say is that ceca possibly has an influence on how we hand out EP to those from india. In order words, we are possibly approving more EP from there TO MAKE UP for the shortfall in ICT so as to make them happy.

Saying that MOM is the ""control point"" is a moot point because as I have already mentioned, who controls MOM? The minister. And the minister is part of the governmentt which negotiates such treaties. If the governmentt agrees to let in more of their people then the minister will take the corresponding action to have mom approve more. As long as the government (ie the leadership) is acceding to their requests, mom cannot do anything about it.

You honestly think india is only happy with 500 ICT when they complained that 10k software workers (ICT +EP) is already not enough and they consider that as a violation of the agreement?

Give you another example:

Company X wants to transfer Mr A from india to work here.

They got 2 ways to do it

First method is to do it via ICT

Second is to do it via normal EP.

If first method rejected, they can still apply under second method. But does it matter to the company? At the end of the day, BOTH WAYS STILL RESULT IN MR A COMING HERE TO WORK FOR THE COMPANY. Just that method one classified under ICT while method 2 classified under EP. But both ORIGINATE from CECA because the company IS TRYING TO BRING IN THEIR OWN PEOPLE FROM india TO WORK HERE RATHER THAN HIRE A LOCAL.

So in effect, we could actually have much more than 500 ""ICT"" if we were to take into account those who were rejected for it but subsequently approved for EP.

india cares about their pmet coming to work here. Whether we let them in via ICT or EP doesn't really matter to them SO LONG AS WE LET THEM IN. Different method, same end goal.

And mom will never reveal anything, you know it in your heart. However, if we can get india to back off and agree that the agreement allows us to limit their numbers to whatever we want, that will make things so much easier for MOM because everything will be in black and white then. If not, this will forever come back to haunt us. Because future leaders of india can come back with the same argument (ie intepretation) again to force their way with us.

The problem is that the agreement has no defined limits/quota in terms of numbers which is why india relied on that argument to say that we violated the agreement because by trying to restrict their numbers (whether ICT or EP), we are putting a limit/quota on them.

So far nobody can explain the need for it. If it still points back to MOM policies, then no real difference with what any other countries citizen has to go through in terms of vetting or be granted work permit / PR.

Hence all the explanations given to date by government is that don't worry, we still control who and how many can be let in. But in that sense, there is really no need to attach a manpower related clause into a trade deal. 

Thinking about it from the Indian point of view, the tightening of US immigration policies under Trump results in many Indians not able to work in US and there is a shortage of good jobs in India for these and hence the clause creates an outlet for their citizens.

I try to explain abit to the best of my knowledge.

Example. 
A company A based in India wanted to setup a branch in Singapore.
They want to transfer 3 senior management staff[intra-corporate transferee (ICT)] to Singapore to oversee the operations. And hire 100 staffs(Local or FTs) in the Singapore branch.

3 senior management staff [intra-corporate transferee (ICT)] - Group A
3 of them has to pass the conditions set out in 
a) CECA Chapter 9
b) MOM EP 
As highlighted earlier , 500/4200 ICTs came from India. So it is not the majority route that they came in from.
Note: there is no FCF required here.

100 staffs (Local or FTs) - Group B
Let assume they hired 1 local and 99 EP holders from India
99 EP holders has to pass the conditions 
a) MOM EP
b) FCF job advertising requirements








                                                Fair Consideration Framework (FCF)
                                        

The Fair Consideration Framework (FCF) sets out requirements for all employers in Singapore to consider the workforce in Singapore fairly for job opportunities. Employers should not discriminate on characteristics that are not related to the job,...




                                        www.mom.gov.sg
                                



As highlighted earlier , approx 25% of 177k EP holders is from India. 

company A
Under FCF , because of the high concentration of a single nationality. These are indicators of possible discriminatory hiring practices. So the company will be under FCF whatchlist.
Possible penalties you can look into the link i provided earlier.

Conclusion
a) As to WHY the clause is there.
Quote from CCS
""Mr Chan said Singapore's Ceca commitments are neither unique nor overly broad, as most of the 164 members of the World Trade Organisation have also made commitments on entry of ICTs under the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Local companies tap Singaporean ICTs too, when they expand overseas, he said.

""It apeopleies equally to Indian companies coming here and to Singapore companies going overseas - under Ceca or under any other (free trade agreements). This is to help them kick-start the overseas operations.""

                                                Even in the US, South Asians say caste has proved hard to escape
                                        

Much like racism in the US, the Indian caste system is deeply rooted and systemic in nature, persisting through cultural notions and institutions even after legal discrimination was abolished.






(CNN) Sam Cornelius knew that something was amiss when his job performance review unexpectedly took a huge hit one year.
It was 2013, and Cornelius had been working as a software engineer in the US for an Indian-headquartered information technology company for five years. Up until then, he said he had been given no indication that his work was lacking in any way.
He could think of nothing that would have prompted his performance rating to drop two levels from the previous year -- except for an incident a month earlier at a dinner with his Indian manager and an American client.
During that dinner, the client, who was White, brought up the subject of caste discrimination in India, Cornelius said. He wanted to get the perspective of Cornelius and his manager, who were both born and raised in India.
India's caste system is a fixed system of social hierarchy that historically defined a person's societal rank and occupation based on the family they were born into. It dates back thousands of years, with its roots in Hindu scriptures, and has since spread to other South Asian religious communities. whatlar systems are also found in some other parts of the world, particularly West Africa.



Wherever South Asians go, they bring caste.
Thenmozhi Soundararajan, executive director of Equality Labs

At the top of the Indian caste hierarchy are Brahmins, who were traditionally priests or scholars. Next are Kshatriyas, who were warriors and rulers.

misrepresentations-of-ceca-have-caused-unnecessary-public-concern-pm-lee.6550705/,Engineeer,"SINGAPORE - Misrepresentations of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (Ceca) have caused much unnecessary public concern, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who highlighted the recent Parliament debate on the matter.

Mr Lee said in a Facebook post on Tuesday (July 6) that Health Minister Ong Ye Kung and Manpower Minister Tan See Leng had set out the facts about free trade agreements and Ceca to put the public debate on a sound factual basis.

""Singaporeans are anxious about jobs, foreign competition, as well as the impact of the large number of foreigners working and living here,"" he said.

""These are valid concerns which we will address. But if we put the blame on Ceca, that will not solve our problem but instead make it worse.""

Mr Lee stressed that Singapore needs access to global markets to earn a living. FTAs play a crucial role in letting the country do so, and he highlighted how Singapore's network of FTAs has created investments and opportunities for businesses here, as well as jobs for Singaporeans.

""They have helped make us a leading global hub,"" added Mr Lee, who also thanked officers who have spent years negotiating FTAs.

In two ministerial statements on Tuesday, Mr Ong and Dr Tan laid out the importance of free trade pacts and debunked falsehoods about Ceca, whose immigration-related elements have come under fire on social media and by the Progress Singapore Party (PSP).

They also stressed that changes in foreign workforce numbers over time are to be expected, given that policies, as well as countries' industry needs, change over time.

Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who was Singapore's chief negotiator of Ceca, also posted about the debate on Tuesday.

""Both Ministers Ong Ye Kung and Tan See Leng gave comprehensive explanations to rebut baseless allegations made by the PSP that Ceca gave professionals from India a 'free hand' to enter Singapore. This is simply false,"" said Mr Heng.

""Nothing in the agreement implies Singapore must unconditionally let in PMEs from India. Contrary to PSP's claim, our ability to impose requirements for immigration and work passes has never been in question in Ceca or any other FTA that we have signed. We must put a stop to this misinformation.""

Mr Heng, who rose to speak in the debate on Tuesday, said that he felt compelled to clarify one of the false allegations made related to a chapter in Ceca.

This chapter, on the movement of people, pertains to temporary entry of individuals into both countries and has been highlighted as part of criticisms of Ceca paving the way for Indian professionals to take jobs from locals.

He said in his Facebook post: ""I put on record that we did not sacrifice our positions on the 'movement of national persons' as a bargaining chip during the negotiations. This chapter of Ceca - which some wrongly believed allowed Indian nationals free movement into Singapore - was one of the most difficult chapters to conclude.

""But we did not and would not give away the rights to decide who can enter to live, work or reside in Singapore. In the end, we landed on an agreement that benefited both countries, while also protecting our vital interests.""

Tan supported and quipped that MOM is only doing its ""bestest"" to create jobs and will only do things that benefit Singapore citizens

Question is the following:
Singapore public has been asking questions about CECA with evidence that Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, Stanchart and BNP Paribas to name a few were loaded with foreign Indians since the past decade! 

Why was this clarification on ceca recruitment not voluntarily presented by the pap gov to the Public? Is it because PAP gov think that Singapore citizens are too dumb to understand this? Or was it because there was some mistakes made and it took time to remedy? 

All policies matters concerning Singapore citizens livelihood and well being have to be transparently presented and revealed! Time and again you have Shamu and sometimes Ong doing the easy defense for not revealing information that it is ""sensitive""!!

Sensitive for whom? If the data is not transparently open and available to the public and the opposition ward, how can policies be appropriately understood or debated??

Or does the pap feel that they always do the right thing? And that they ""ownself check ownself"" multilevel to ensure they do not screwup the lives of Singapore citizens??

My message to the pap gov is that, this ""ownself check ownself "" policy has failed. People in the age group of 40-60y old are suppose be looking forward to better lives in old age with hope to retire with some savings and money and maybe we can go to the Tanjong Pagar Connector park (little india 2) and walk around and enjoy the scenary! 

That is almost not possible now because our lives are disrupted! You want this group of older citizens to seriously work in good jobs of grab drivers? nurses? kindergarten teachers? These jobs pay less than EP salary!

because in the last 20 over years the PAP bring in alot of low quality foreigners, economic refugees, 3rd world country village people.
And when they stayed longer and earned few thousand dollars they think damn cool and on the same level as Singaporeans.

How CECA concerns come about i am not interested. PSP is trying to find out whether CECA is net beneficial to Singaporean as an individual job seeker. Because they are the one who give VOTES. So what if you found out that it is not beneficial to individuals job seeker but it is beneficial to others such as companies , F&B , real estate etc. 

You ask to shut CECA? Others who benefit will complain. It is an endless cycle.

""Admitting you have a problem is the first step in fixing the problem""Ã¢ÂÂThe gun is pointing at PSP to drop the CECA issues and focus on manpower issue.

Pushing to the main issue is critical. So that focus and question can direct to the correct issue on hand.

More importantly, we want to know whether our MOM work permit policy is too lax that compromise our Singaporeans job seeker interests. And maybe is there any unfair hiring involved?",, how ceca concerns come about i am not interested psp is trying to find out whether ceca is net beneficial to singaporean as an individual job seeker because they are the one who give votes so what if you found out that it is not beneficial to individuals job seeker but it is beneficial to others such as companies  fb  real estate etc   you ask to shut ceca others who benefit will complain it is an endless cycle  admitting you have a problem is the first step in fixing the problemÃ¢  the gun is pointing at psp to drop the ceca issues and focus on manpower issue  pushing to the main issue is critical so that focus and question can direct to the correct issue on hand  more importantly we want to know whether our mom work permit policy is too lax that compromise our singaporeans job seeker interests and maybe is there any unfair hiring involved,ceca concerns come interested psp trying find whether ceca net beneficial singaporean individual job seeker one give votes found beneficial individuals job seeker beneficial others companies fb real estate etc ask shut ceca others benefit complain endless cycle admitting problem first step fixing problemÃ¢ gun pointing psp drop ceca issues focus manpower issue pushing main issue critical focus question direct correct issue hand importantly want know whether mom work permit policy lax compromise singaporeans job seeker interests maybe unfair hiring involved, concerns come interested psp trying find whether  net beneficial singaporean individual job seeker one give votes found beneficial individuals job seeker beneficial others companies fb real estate etc ask shut  others benefit complain endless cycle admitting problem first step fixing problemÃ¢ gun pointing psp drop  issues focus manpower issue pushing main issue critical focus question direct correct issue hand importantly want know whether mom work permit policy lax compromise singaporeans job seeker interests maybe unfair hiring involved,Negative

I wont describe it as a fault because it is still up to debate.
But It does matter who you point against.

if you are coming from the point of view that we want fair treatment , fair hiring , equal treatment , then we must be fair and aim at the right policy. We should left CECA alone for many reasons that was shared in the ministerial statement and other NCMPs, MPs.
And let focus on MOM policy instead.

What done cannot be undone. Moving forward , what need to be done? I heard people say HR must be SG citizens. Does it work? 
If we set new criteria, should be review all approved EPs application again ?
