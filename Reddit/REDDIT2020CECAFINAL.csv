Xenophobic or not but alluding that all / most Indian nationals working in Singapore have anything to do with CECA is ignorant.

Growing anti-CECA sentiments is neither xenophobic NOR racist,jabadahut22,"It is xenophobic and racist. Period.

What is the number of Indians coming through the CECA agreement? People always point to CBP and MBFC. If the companies are clustered there, of course, there is going to be a higher population of a certain nationality there. Is the clustering evident in other areas of Singapore? It is a hard no.

Secondly, there is tech and finance talent in India. And bucket loads. If you don't sweeten a deal with them, these talents will end up going to neighbouring countries to build their economies. It's a threat to Singapore especially as our strategy going forward is to be a smart nation.

Those delusional Singaporeans who claim they are very competent.

Growing anti-CECA sentiments is neither xenophobic NOR racist,saywuhtt,"Are you Hindu or even Indian for that matter? I'm seeing a sickening growing trend of some Singaporean Chinese who 'think' they know other people's culture and acting like they've got the authority to represent them. You don't.

This is my lived experience and never in my conversation with other Indians be it local or 'CECA' has the issue of caste been brought it. It's pretty much a social faux pas and has been abolished since independence. Not even my own 'CECA' parents raised me to know my caste and I never once asked. The fight against caste based discrimination (which has no religious sanction by the way) has been going on since the 17th century. You make it sound like it is a concept we openly embrace WHEN IT IS NOT. It is a Vedic social order that had it's purpose in the past but not anymore and we were well aware of that for centuries now. We have no need for your 'advice' :) 

Of course there will be instances of people discriminating those of the 'lower caste'. In which society do we not see pricks who were born into privilege cling onto their ill-gotten privilege. Their casteism, our classism and cronyism. Who are you trying to kid here by labelling them as some group of deplorables importing their bad practices? We've already figured out how to look down upon those born into a less privileged strata. We don't need casteist Brahmins for that.

I am inclined to agree that anti foreigner sentiments are ultimately rooted in rice-bowl concerns. I understand those sentiments. Citizens must be placed first in their own country, that would only make sense. 

Anti-CECA concerns on the other hand, I'm not entirely sure. The slurs and insults that have been used against Indian nationals have been used against me; a local Indian who grew up here and did his NS. Take a look online and see how many fucking racist jokes are being made when Indian nationals or CECA is raised. I am well aware of the racial undertones of these anti - CECA sentiments. There is no strong local vs 'mainland' Indian divide. We don't subscribe to your brand of self-hate. Don't act like you understand our culture / community. 

We have an influx of foreigners from China as well. We have entire offices pretty much dominated by them. Yet we have this selective outrage against the 'CECAs' because they're of a less preferred race? Don't get me wrong, I welcome immigrants from China, not once have I been called slurs by them unlike the locals. I've had great mentors from China who have even taught me Mandarin which none of my local Chinese friends ever do because being bad at Mandarin is apparently a badge of honour these days.

You should start to listen to your own advice. 

I've read the main post twice now and nowhere in the OP's submisssion did he say every brown person is ""inherently evil and tyrannical"".

Similar language on movement of natural persons in the CECA can be found in other FTAs that Singapore signed. Like the US-SG FTA and the CPTPP. 

If you look at the US SG FTA, pages 125-128.. 

.. Is pretty similar to CECA's chapter on movement of natural persons here


Nothing in those FTAs prevents Singapore from having is own rules on immigration. Looking at the CECA chapter on movement of natural persons, article 9.1.3 says:

Nothing contained in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry or temporary stay of natural persons of the other Party in its territory, including measures necessary to protect the integrity of its territory and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across its borders, provided such measures are not applied in a manner so as to unduly impair the benefits accruing to the other Party or delay trade in goods or services or conduct of investment activities under this Agreement. 

So I am unsure why the need to single out CECA.

All free trade of flows of goods and people are assumed to have the effect of lowering the labour cost and the cost of goods and services and overall, benefit the most number of people. As [Milton Friedman]would have put it: protectionism protects a small number of vocal beneficiaries but disadvantage the mass of consumers who would otherwise get cheaper goods and services. Locals whose jobs are displaced by cheaper labours usually will pay just as much taxes as the migrant labours but have access to welfare programs that allow them to upskill and get into better jobs.

The other part of these agreements is a free flow of capital and investment.

Now, here's the incredibly tricky part. Anti-free trade people are almost universally against free flow of goods (putting local manufacturing out of business) and people (jobs, etc ...) but will be OK for free-flow of capitals. After all, foreigners are pouring money into our economy so what can be so wrong with that. It's ""free money"". However, the problem is free capital flow is usually a bigger problem than free flow of goods.

Let's not forget that all the recessions have been a Minsky moment of deleveraging. A Minsky moment is during the time of great capital and liquidity availability, loans are cheap and interest rates are low. People go a bit crazy on taking out loans to hypothetically do business, but more often, they use it to buy assets land, real estates, bonds, etc ...) and drive up asset price. Then the party and bubble eventually ended and people and businesses go bankrupt. Alternatively, capital flight occur and people take their money and just go elsewhere. In any case, recessions are highly traumatic, painful, and disruptive.

In the Bretton-Woods system post-WWII, free trade and movement of labour were considered by Keynes as generally things but free movement of capitals isn't. This is something that only very recently [academics] have been looking at it seriously.

Here's very expensive question: Singapore makes a huge amount of money by being a financial centre. This means free flow of capitals.

Probably not, but if companies move out SG due to regulatory environments and reduction in trade surplus and even more people lose their jobs, would it not be worse?

People have a misconception that employment is a zero-sum game, that when 1 foreign gets a job, 1 Singaporean loses it. But the truth is quite different. When Singapore is successful at becoming a region centre - then we create more jobs. Jobs that would all move to another country in a heart-beat if quota restrictions forced companies to move.

The thing is, Singapore has almost no domestic market. We can't convince companies to headquarters Singapore like China.

So it is a fine balance that we have to make.

While I can't speak for all sectors. In my field (R&D, artificial intelligence), every capable Singaporean I know is hired.

Better JOBS for Singaporeans,masterdaryl,"Again, this is not a provision specific to CECA. (Copying my reply here again) 

Similar language on movement of natural persons in the CECA can be found in other FTAs that Singapore signed. Like the US-SG FTA and the CPTPP. 

If you look at the US SG FTA, pages 125-128.. 
.. Is pretty similar to CECA's chapter on movement of natural persons here

Nothing in those FTAs prevents Singapore from having is own rules on immigration. Looking at the CECA chapter on movement of natural persons, article 9.1.3 says:

Nothing contained in this Chapter shall prevent a Party from applying measures to regulate the entry or temporary stay of natural persons of the other Party in its territory, including measures necessary to protect the integrity of its territory and to ensure the orderly movement of natural persons across its borders, provided such measures are not applied in a manner so as to unduly impair the benefits accruing to the other Party or delay trade in goods or services or conduct of investment activities under this Agreement.

Better JOBS for Singaporeans,Pandacius,"While what you say is true, Singapore disproportionately benefits from these FTAs. For country of 5 million, it has an incredible amount of R&D centers, regional company headquarters etc. All of this means that many and resources from the entire SEA region (and much of Asia-Pacific) is funnelled into Singapore. This is what is allowing Singaporeans to enjoy world-class medical care, public facilities and universities, and subsidised housing while paying some of the world's lowest taxes.

I disagree with what you say regarding '""you & I could easily be on the next flight out to steal another job from another local in their own country ''. It is true that we can fly out if R&D centre shifts to say, Shenzhen. But when we do that, we would not be stealing a job from a local Shenzhener. If say I opened an R&D centre there, that'd be 8 new positions for PhD research scientists, including probably 2 locals. And then supporting them are project officers/research engineers - about 20 extra jobs, which probably 15 locals. Then human resources, another 5 - all local.

Thoughts about recent (racist) events,ngrenjie,"I donât think itâs so much about racism or xenophobia. Rather, there seems to growing discontent of late over the impression (be it real or perceived) that foreign workers seem to be getting better treatment than locals. News of late of our government seemingly bending over backwards to ensure that the food is to their palate, housing them in apparently âatasâ places like hotels and cruise ships. 

I think this also taps into deep-seated resentment over the governmentâs importing of foreign labour, which have both depressed wages in certain industries and strained our infrastructure. Over at EDMW, there have been threads about how foreigners in managerial posts use their positions and influence to hire more of their own race, essentially forming enclaves at work and further squeezing out locals. Then you have the ever-thorny issue of local men having to serve NS while foreigners are not subject to the same âburdenâ. 

Back when the economy was still going strong, most people were busy enough making ends meet to really ponder over such stuff. Now with the pandemic resulting in more people being retrenched, taking NPL or just being stuck at home with less work or nothing to do, you have more people with more time on their hands and consequently, more time to feel angry and frustrated over the current situation. The whole CB is not helping things either, as trapping people at home means more opportunity for these negative emotions to fester, because there are fewer things to get distracted with. 

So if you ask me, the people are angry at the government, and foreign workers represent an easy target for them to vent their frustrations on. This shows in them wanting to see foreigners being subject to the same punitive actions that they themselves have to abide by, and any tardiness by the authorities in doing so just feeds into their own belief that these foreign workers are indeed getting preferential treatment from the government. 

Thatâs just my take at least.",10,1588589524,4/5/2020 10:52,i don t think it s so much about racism or xenophobia rather there seems to growing discontent of late over the impression be it real or perceived that foreign workers seem to be getting better treatment than locals news of late of our government seemingly bending over backwards to ensure that the food is to their palate housing them in apparently  atas  places like hotels and cruise ships   i think this also taps into deepseated resentment over the government s importing of foreign labour which have both depressed wages in certain industries and strained our infrastructure over at edmw there have been threads about how foreigners in managerial posts use their positions and influence to hire more of their own race essentially forming enclaves at work and further squeezing out locals then you have the everthorny issue of local men having to serve ns while foreigners are not subject to the same  burden    back when the economy was still going strong most people were busy enough making ends meet to really ponder over such stuff now with the pandemic resulting in more people being retrenched taking npl or just being stuck at home with less work or nothing to do you have more people with more time on their hands and consequently more time to feel angry and frustrated over the current situation the whole cb is not helping things either as trapping people at home means more opportunity for these negative emotions to fester because there are fewer things to get distracted with   so if you ask me the people are angry at the government and foreign workers represent an easy target for them to vent their frustrations on this shows in them wanting to see foreigners being subject to the same punitive actions that they themselves have to abide by and any tardiness by the authorities in doing so just feeds into their own belief that these foreign workers are indeed getting preferential treatment from the government   that s just my take at least,think much racism xenophobia rather seems growing discontent late impression real perceived foreign workers seem getting better treatment locals news late government seemingly bending backwards ensure food palate housing apparently atas places like hotels cruise ships think also taps deepseated resentment government importing foreign labour depressed wages certain industries strained infrastructure edmw threads foreigners managerial posts use positions influence hire race essentially forming enclaves work squeezing locals everthorny issue local men serve ns foreigners subject burden back economy still going strong people busy enough making ends meet really ponder stuff pandemic resulting people retrenched taking npl stuck home less work nothing people time hands consequently time feel angry frustrated current situation whole cb helping things either trapping people home means opportunity negative emotions fester fewer things get distracted ask people angry government foreign workers represent easy target vent frustrations shows wanting see foreigners subject punitive actions abide tardiness authorities feeds belief foreign workers indeed getting preferential treatment government take least,Negative,Negative,think much racism xenophobia rather seems growing discontent late impression real perceived s seem getting better treatment locals news late government seemingly bending backwards ensure food palate housing apparently atas places like hotels cruise ships think also taps deepseated resentment government importing foreign labour depressed wages certain industries strained infrastructure edmw threads foreigners managerial posts use positions influence hire race essentially forming enclaves work squeezing locals everthorny issue local men serve ns foreigners subject burden back economy still going strong people busy enough making ends meet really ponder stuff pandemic resulting people retrenched taking npl stuck home less work nothing people time hands consequently time feel angry frustrated current situation whole cb helping things either trapping people home means opportunity negative emotions fester fewer things get distracted ask people angry government s represent easy target vent frustrations shows wanting see foreigners subject punitive actions abide tardiness authorities feeds belief s indeed getting preferential treatment government take least

For the poor and low-educated in the majority ethnic group, itâs hard to reconcile the fact that you donât really have any barriers but yet still do poorly when compared to minorities or even foreigners. Itâs hard to hear the news that youâre below average, no matter who you may be. 

On top of that thereâs also culture. Letâs face it, lots of Chinese parents tell their kids a story about Chinese being superior to other races. âDonât be like a XXX race/nationality.â But when they grow up, and they find that in some cases, they are not superior to these people, they get upset because their worldview just breaks down.

Good point. I think it comes back to civility, at least initially. If one's first encounter with me on a subject is a snark-filled ad-hominem attack, then my willingness to react positively will likely be degraded. I believe that, even in that sort of instance, the offended party is under some degree of social obligation to make his *initial response* as civil and courteous as practicable; it's not without precedent that someone (me included) just wades into something with steel-spiked boots and simply needs a gentle reminder. If that doesn't help, *and* if the response merely pours petrol on the fire, then a more forceful reply may well be warranted. Achieving that consistently is admittedly aspirational, but what point is there to aspiration without sincere effort?

If I have caused offence to innocent bystanders in this or any other thread, I apologise. However, I have found a saying attributed to David Lee Roth to be depressingly regularly appropriate in regard to those who engage in unprovoked, unexplained attacks:

Potentially sensitive topic: What is the opinion of local Singaporeans regarding mainland Chinese immigrants (including very successful ones)? -- Is the opinion on r/singapore an accurate reflection of Singapore opinion as a whole?,C3353,"Just my $0.02 feel free to correct me.

My own thoughts towards mainland Chinese immigrants who come here for education and job opportunities is largely neutral. I don't fault them for coming to Singapore for better opportunities. Many Singaporeans also go abroad for the same reason. It would be a bit hypocritical to criticise another for the same thing we do.

Whereas mainland Chinese who come here for citizenship I'll admit I don't have much of an opinion bc I don't really come across them or read about them. But also I don't hate them either our chinese ancestors we're from mainland China, so it would also be hypocritical to say that they shouldn't be allowed to settle down here when our own ancestors did the same. I guess the problem comes with identity and assimilation. Because if you choose to be accept being a Singaporean citizen then you should not view yourself as simply a Chinese, China man but rather a Chinese Singaporean man. There's no need to forsake their culture but they should take up a Singaporean identity.

But the problem comes when they don't assimilate or we don't allow them to assimilate. How many of us can say we know a mainland Chinese person or family well, how many can say that we are close to them?

Also Singaporeâs identity is still forming we are only 55 years old. I feel that there is a fear that an increased amount of mainland Chinese immigrants will cause our own identity will be eroded because of theirs.

Moreover recently there has been increased Chinese aggression and tension. Hence the fear that one day China might turn against us which results in us spurning mainland Chinese immigrants. And we've had it with the Singapore equals China jokes.

I think one of them even got a degree in the US after JC but still came back to Singapore to set up his business?

But I suspect your question targets mainland Chinese specifically. On that, there is a certain level of skepticism of expressed exasperation towards the following.

1. The expectation that Singaporeans should specifically be *more* welcoming towards those who come from mainland China (than immigrants of other races) because of some warped notion of ""shared heritage"". This expectation is particularly abrasive when coming from authorities, but even more so when expressed by (a small but vocal minority) of the said immigrants. The most insensitive remarks are those made by a handful of extreme (ethno-)nationalists who'd claim ""credit"" whenever Singapore does well, ascribing our success to ""superior Chinese virtues"" while calling us race traitors when we screw up.
2. The belief---particularly amongst so-called ""policy bigwigs""---that Chinese nationals are somehow more likely to integrate because of ... i dunno, skin colour?. My interactions with mainland Chinese both in Singapore and abroad is that they are there simply as a temporarily as a stepping stone, or to hedge their work experience. I observe this far more frequently than any other ethnic demographic or nationality. Heck, I have a number of Chinese friends who hold 2-3 PR positions at once, and are simply waiting to see which country offers the best career opportunities. No attempt to integrate or learn the culture any of these countries at all. One of them has US green card but has difficulties ordering food in the US even though he speaks fluent enough english (he used to be a SG PR till NS came knocking). Let me be clear, *there is nothing inherently wrong with this attitude*\---they are just seeking better lives. What *is* mind-boggling is how policymakers (continue to) attempt to woo Chinese nationals over (in a bid to maintain racial demographics) while expecting them to integrate into Singaporean society.

I personally don't think they need or should assimilate in terms of culture. Culture is something personal so their culture should be theirs to choose and practice.

And I guess the reason for assimilating (in terms of behavior not culture) is because you are joining an established society. And since you chose to join it then you should follow its behaviors.

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,law90026,"As Iâve said before, I think most of us are not against foreign talent in Singapore. We are not completely stupid to think that our borders should be closed and that every job should be filled by Singaporeans, no matter how much people want to try and portray Singaporeans (whether generally or specific communities like Reddit) as xenophobic. 

Slight digression: how many countries are more welcoming of foreigners than us in all honesty? Racism abounds in many western countries. Do we scream xenophobia there? Theyâre immigration policies are even more restrictive. Why arenât there articles slamming their xenophobia.

Back to the point at hand: itâs an issue of whether our current measures serve as a way to suppress local wages (inadvertently perhaps) and whether hiring policies show structural flaws.

By allowing the importation of âcheapâ PMET labor, that sets a floor for the salary for PMETs in a way. Why hire a local if you can hire a cheaper foreigner? Stories also abound about how quotas can be gotten around by upgrading these employees from SP holders to EP holders but salaries are withheld or rebated back to the company.

As recent government action has shown, and again perhaps itâs just lip service, there appear to be some issues with hiring in Singapore. Example of this would be the MAS policies. That suggests that there are things which can be improved.

Of course the Astro-turfing has begun now with recent articles by expatriates about how all these measures will be a serious problem for Singapore.

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,minisoo,"I feel there is a distinct challenge between implementing the âidealâ policy versus enforcing it which we need to recognise. For example, if the Government decides the need for more stringent vetting processes on foreign workersâ credentials as part of a new policy, can the Government reliably enforce it at individual level? This is considering that there are slips even when the companies do their own interviews from time to time. If the Government canât reliably enforce such a policy, then wouldnât such a policy be nothing but a paper tiger with no bite?

The Government can probably require companies to submit employees ratio based on foreign nationalities versus Singapore core on a yearly basis but still, further work needs to be done to ascertain the âidealâ ratio for each sector (i.e. based on the maturity of the sector, availability of local manpower resources, industry benchmarks, etc).",3,1599130591,3/9/2020 10:56,i feel there is a distinct challenge between implementing the  ideal  policy versus enforcing it which we need to recognise for example if the government decides the need for more stringent vetting processes on foreign workers  credentials as part of a new policy can the government reliably enforce it at individual level this is considering that there are slips even when the companies do their own interviews from time to time if the government can t reliably enforce such a policy then wouldn t such a policy be nothing but a paper tiger with no bite  the government can probably require companies to submit employees ratio based on foreign nationalities versus singapore core on a yearly basis but still further work needs to be done to ascertain the  ideal  ratio for each sector ie based on the maturity of the sector availability of local manpower resources industry benchmarks etc,feel distinct challenge implementing ideal policy versus enforcing need recognise example government decides need stringent vetting processes foreign workers credentials part new policy government reliably enforce individual level considering slips even companies interviews time time government reliably enforce policy policy nothing paper tiger bite government probably require companies submit employees ratio based foreign nationalities versus singapore core yearly basis still work needs done ascertain ideal ratio sector ie based maturity sector availability local manpower resources industry benchmarks etc,Neutral,Neutral,feel distinct challenge implementing ideal policy versus enforcing need recognise example government decides need stringent vetting processes s credentials part new policy government reliably enforce individual level considering slips even companies interviews time time government reliably enforce policy policy nothing paper tiger bite government probably require companies submit employees ratio based foreign nationalities versus singapore core yearly basis still work needs done ascertain ideal ratio sector ie based maturity sector availability local manpower resources industry benchmarks etc

I feel that while businesses are forced to increase the wages for foreign workers, they will also have to increase the minimum wage of Singaporeans. 

Cause if they don't Singaporeans will have more to complain. ""Why FT getting paid more then local talent?""

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,zoinks10,"I really, really donât understand why people think raising the EP salary requirement is a raise of the salary for a foreigner. These 2 things are not equal. 

What that means is that if I have a job that pays $3,600 a month I could give it to either a Singaporean or a foreigner. When they raise the EP threshold to $3,900 I can now only give that job to a Singaporean because Iâm no longer able to get a foreigner on an EP to do the job due to the rule change. 

In your head (and in a lot of others) you seem to think Iâll then make the economic choice to pay the foreigner $300 more a month than he or she is worth. Why would I do that? 

The only way that happens is if the local workforce competition is nonexistent for this (i.e. no local exists that is either willing or able to do the job at that salary level). 

In reality the deck is stacked even more in the favour of hiring a Singaporean to do this job due to the wage credits Iâm currently getting to hire locals, and due to the wage credits employers get for hiring locals anyway (outside of pandemic times I still get money from the government when I increase the salary of a Singaporean but not if I do so for a foreigner). 

As you can see, no rational human would choose to hire the foreigner, unless they canât get a local to do the job. 

If they canât get a local it could be:

1.) no one is willing to work in the sector or in the role for the money (this is complex in itself and relates to how we value different roles), or

2.) no one is capable of doing the job (in which case we need to consider how to leverage training and get more locals into a field)

Both cases require changing things that should benefit Singaporeans, but the core message is the EP salary threshold raise is not a wage rise for a foreigner, itâs a hike on the baseline wage at which a foreigner can compete with a Singaporean for a job. It helps those locals that earn less than whatever the salary threshold happens to be by removing their competition.",3,1599184709,4/9/2020 1:58,i really really don t understand why people think raising the ep salary requirement is a raise of the salary for a foreigner these  things are not equal   what that means is that if i have a job that pays  a month i could give it to either a singaporean or a foreigner when they raise the ep threshold to  i can now only give that job to a singaporean because i m no longer able to get a foreigner on an ep to do the job due to the rule change   in your head and in a lot of others you seem to think i ll then make the economic choice to pay the foreigner  more a month than he or she is worth why would i do that   the only way that happens is if the local workforce competition is nonexistent for this ie no local exists that is either willing or able to do the job at that salary level   in reality the deck is stacked even more in the favour of hiring a singaporean to do this job due to the wage credits i m currently getting to hire locals and due to the wage credits employers get for hiring locals anyway outside of pandemic times i still get money from the government when i increase the salary of a singaporean but not if i do so for a foreigner   as you can see no rational human would choose to hire the foreigner unless they can t get a local to do the job   if they can t get a local it could be   no one is willing to work in the sector or in the role for the money this is complex in itself and relates to how we value different roles or   no one is capable of doing the job in which case we need to consider how to leverage training and get more locals into a field  both cases require changing things that should benefit singaporeans but the core message is the ep salary threshold raise is not a wage rise for a foreigner it s a hike on the baseline wage at which a foreigner can compete with a singaporean for a job it helps those locals that earn less than whatever the salary threshold happens to be by removing their competition,really really understand people think raising ep salary requirement raise salary foreigner things equal means job pays month could give either singaporean foreigner raise ep threshold give job singaporean longer able get foreigner ep job due rule change head lot others seem think make economic choice pay foreigner month worth would way happens local workforce competition nonexistent ie local exists either willing able job salary level reality deck stacked even favour hiring singaporean job due wage credits currently getting hire locals due wage credits employers get hiring locals anyway outside pandemic times still get money government increase salary singaporean foreigner see rational human would choose hire foreigner unless get local job get local could one willing work sector role money complex relates value different roles one capable job case need consider leverage training get locals field cases require changing things benefit singaporeans core message ep salary threshold raise wage rise foreigner hike baseline wage foreigner compete singaporean job helps locals earn less whatever salary threshold happens removing competition,Neutral,Neutral,really really understand people think raising ep salary requirement raise salary foreigner things equal means job pays month could give either singaporean foreigner raise ep threshold give job singaporean longer able get foreigner ep job due rule change head lot others seem think make economic choice pay foreigner month worth would way happens local workforce competition nonexistent ie local exists either willing able job salary level reality deck stacked even favour hiring singaporean job due wage credits currently getting hire locals due wage credits employers get hiring locals anyway outside pandemic times still get money government increase salary singaporean foreigner see rational human would choose hire foreigner unless get local job get local could one willing work sector role money complex relates value different roles one capable job case need consider leverage training get locals field cases require changing things benefit singaporeans core message ep salary threshold raise wage rise foreigner hike baseline wage foreigner compete singaporean job helps locals earn less whatever salary threshold happens removing competition

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,Uberj4ger,"Cost of living of foreigners is not exactly higher than that of locals.

Soz to burst your bubble here but...

It heavily depends on whether the foreigners working here have their families living here or back home.

From what I observe most of the foreign talent here have families living back home in their home countries, they only pay for a single room in a sublet flat/condo (usually flat) and they send most of their money back. Most of them meal prep as well and rarely eat out.

If they need health checkups/surgery they're more likely to do it when they're back home on a long holiday as opposed to doing it in Singapore where medical fees can be 3-5 times more. 

Whereas if you're a Singaporean you're not as likely to rent and paying monthly installments for your flat (let alone a condo if you were crazy/optimistic about your pay growth) is much higher than rental. 

You also pay the local costs of health/insurance and medical fees and if you're unfortunate enough to be your parent's retirement plan, the cost of living and their health and medical costs as well. All in SGD.

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,El_Sid1990,"I am sorry mate, but apart from the foreign workers in the dorms, and of course the maids, the foreigners do not live in sublet flat/condo rooms and they do not send most of the money back home.

The majority of people on EP and SP are here with the family, and even the singles they live a normal life, when they rent a unit (generally a condo, and because renting an HDB is not easy as it sounds, there are quite a lot of limitations), does not go back for healthcare (in my country I am not eligible to free healthcare anymore, since I am a foreign resident, and anyway it takes 15 hours the least if I have to go back with urgency) and often does not even earn so much to put aside/send back tons of money.

A single guy with 6,000SGD a month (above the minimum for the EP) does not really have the chance to save so much money as a lot of people might think, unless he is either very young (and would not be paid 6/7 a month) or he decides to downgrade his living standard (which you do not want to go 10.000km away for that).

There is a misconception that an EP is here on 20.000 a month. 
This is absolutely not the case at all - I would say that people below 35 on EP and SP are often below the 8K mark. 
It sounds a lot, but as a foreigner is not, not at all, considering there is zero welfare for us in here.

If you do not agree, try to raise a family with 10K and: 
\- No medicare 
\- No CPF 
\- No HDB/BTO 
\- High stamp-duty to buy a property, and the average price for a 2 bedder for foreigners, being a condo, is around 850.000k 
\- No public school 
\- No subsidies at all

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,Uberj4ger,"I mean, sure, if your family is in Singapore then most definitely your cost of living is going to skyrocket.

I'd like to point out that your example is purely anecdotal as well, most foreigners working in Singapore are one of the three nationalities of either Malaysia, India or the Philippines. Your description of bringing your family over with you doesn't seem reflective of someone who is from these countries.

Let me explain.

Most of my observations are formed by having conversations with my colleagues from these nationalities. And one thing is pretty apparent, almost all of them (unless one of the spouses is in upper management) do not live with their families in Singapore because the costs their family incur in their home countries is a third to a fifth of the costs of raising a family in Singapore. Their incomes will not allow them to raise their families in Singapore, but provide their families back home a comfortable quality of life there.

Almost all of them rent sublet flats with a smaller number of them renting sublet condos at an approximate ratio of about 5:1. I was surprised to hear this too from my Malaysian colleague, then I realized that over the past 10 years the exchange rate went from 1:2 to 1:3. Look up the Ruppee to SGD trendline and you'll notice something similar.

Even if they could buy a flat in Singapore at the subsidized rate of 350-500k SGD that amount would translate to a much higher quality of life for them and their families if they buy properties back home in Malaysia, Philipines or India. Heck, even a plate of nasi lemak in Kuala lumpur is going to cost my Malaysian colleague 2-3 times less the amount of what I get in a hawker center in Singapore. The cost of delivering a child in India is 5 times less than that in Singapore.

Your experiences seem more inline with colleagues who are either from the West (US or UK) or Australia. In those cases, they bring their families with them because of either expatriate packages, or because the cost of living in where they are from is not too far off from the cost of living in Singapore. But those are a minority when it comes to EP holders and SP.

Thereâs no way to show that the majority of people on EP and SP are here with the family. Please support with evidence.

When they rent, thereâs no evidence that each of them rent an entire condo unit by themselves. Again please show evidence. 

Youâve made assumptions on the median for SP and EP holders. 

Everything youâve posted is completely anecdotal.

Let me give you my own anecdotal evidence since we are going down this road. I know expats who are on 30-50k a month packages, not including ancillaries like schooling and housing. I know expats who rent GCBs. I know expats where both husband and wife are working and earning a lot. Does this mean that all expats have the same life? Of course not but donât make itâs kind like every expat in Singapore is suffering. Because if they were, they wouldnât be here.

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,Uberj4ger,"your employer contributes 17%, you contribute 20%, that's a total of 37%

Your take home pay is actually only 63% of your total income. 

Do take note that there is a maximum CPF contribution per year. Meaning to say if you earn more than a certain amount, your CPF contribution % will start dropping.

I.e. If you make 20k a month your CPF contribution will be about 2.2k which is closer to 11% of your income. Your employer contribution here is only 1k and your own contribution is 1.2k.

Have the government missed the point on the foreign talent issue?,zoinks10,"My best guess is that some people are hurting financially, worried about their future, and looking over their shoulder. That causes a different way of thinking than when you're ""fat and happy"" with life.

Studies have shown that the amount you earn isn't strongly correlated with your happiness working in a particular job. However if you know (or suspect) that you are being paid less than someone else for the same work your dissatisfaction and unhappiness goes through the roof.

The people on here that are complaining are likely to be those either starting out in life and hoping for better opportunities than there are now, or those that have not got the big wage salary that they've read about in the papers. They will be hating foreigners for ""taking their job or opportunity away"" because it's easier to focus your hate externally (""that bastard who isn't like me caused me harm"") than to accept responsibility (""I'm not actually very good at running a multinational corporation, perhaps that's why I don't get callbacks from the 200,000,000 CV's I've spammed about the job"").

I understand the frustration of those that are suffering financially.

Discussion on the role educational institutions are failing to take,nova9001,"My thoughts on university education in Singapore because that's the only education I experienced in Singapore:

1. Too much emphasis on academic performance which is graded by your ability to memorize and regurgitate that information in exam. This has no use whatsoever in real world. 
2. Lack of critical thinking. Yes there are group projects that adds to your performance other than exams but everyone still wants to team with the person with the best academic performance. No other skill set matters like . Doesn't matter if you are creative, you think outside the box, you have different ways to do things. 
3. professors are too busy with research. When it comes to Singapore university's, professors main job isn't teaching its doing research to get results. As such they spend the minimum amount of time on teaching, their notes are never updated. I was talking with my manager he was 10 + years my senior and we realize the prof still using the same notes.

Discussion on the role educational institutions are failing to take,bloopwhatisthis,"To be fair, I've actually seen a greater focus by educational institutions in terms of support for their graduating students and alumnis. The resource has always been there but in recent years I've personally seen more and more resources emerging for graduating students to tap on.

While your point of trying to get these institutions to take on some sort of responsibility in preparing students better for the workforce is understandable, the responsibility ultimately falls on to the students. The educational institutions can only try to promote and raise awareness about the available resources out there but at the end of the day, you can't force students to do what they don't want to do. With the current curriculums in place, there already is a pretty packed schedule in terms of learning content so there will inevitably be some sacrifice in terms of learning quality somewhere. 

If anything, I think SG is picking up some right things as a whole with more traineeships for graduating students who may not wish to pursue further studies or are unable to do so. I actually see a lot of value in having apprenticeships as this is an alternative path for people who feel like they do not conform to the traditional ones. I believe that SG has something similar but over in United kingdom they have 18-24 months apprenticeships which will lead the apprentice or trainee to finish with a professional certification equivalent to a diploma or degree related to the role that they are in. With the emergence of the modern apprenticeship, I've had colleagues in their late 20s taking on the apprenticeship to compliment their job functions as well as to raise the level of both their soft and hard skills.

This will no doubt take time to shift the mentality of the masses that there are many other paths available to students to take compared to the only traditional ones.",7,1602034065,7/10/2020 1:27,to be fair i have actually seen a greater focus by educational institutions in terms of support for their graduating students and alumnis the resource has always been there but in recent years i have personally seen more and more resources emerging for graduating students to tap on  while your point of trying to get these institutions to take on some sort of responsibility in preparing students better for the workforce is understandable the responsibility ultimately falls on to the students the educational institutions can only try to promote and raise awareness about the available resources out there but at the end of the day you can not force students to do what they do not want to do with the current curriculums in place there already is a pretty packed schedule in terms of learning content so there will inevitably be some sacrifice in terms of learning quality somewhere   if anything i think sg is picking up some right things as a whole with more traineeships for graduating students who may not wish to pursue further studies or are unable to do so i actually see a lot of value in having apprenticeships as this is an alternative path for people who feel like they do not conform to the traditional ones i believe that sg has something similar but over in united kingdom they have  months apprenticeships which will lead the apprentice or trainee to finish with a professional certification equivalent to a diploma or degree related to the role that they are in with the emergence of the modern apprenticeship i have had colleagues in their late  taking on the apprenticeship to compliment their job functions as well as to raise the level of both their soft and hard skills  this will no doubt take time to shift the mentality of the masses that there are many other paths available to students to take compared to the only traditional ones,fair actually seen greater focus educational institutions terms support graduating students alumnis resource always recent years personally seen resources emerging graduating students tap point trying get institutions take sort responsibility preparing students better workforce understandable responsibility ultimately falls students educational institutions try promote raise awareness available resources end day force students want current curriculums place already pretty packed schedule terms learning content inevitably sacrifice terms learning quality somewhere anything think sg picking right things whole traineeships graduating students may wish pursue studies unable actually see lot value apprenticeships alternative path people feel like conform traditional ones believe sg something similar united kingdom months apprenticeships lead apprentice trainee finish professional certification equivalent diploma degree related role emergence modern apprenticeship colleagues late taking apprenticeship compliment job functions well raise level soft hard skills doubt take time shift mentality masses many paths available students take compared traditional ones,,Neutral,fair actually seen greater focus educational institutions terms support graduating students alumnis resource always recent years personally seen resources emerging graduating students tap point trying get institutions take sort responsibility preparing students better workforce understandable responsibility ultimately falls students educational institutions try promote raise awareness available resources end day force students want current curriculums place already pretty packed schedule terms learning content inevitably sacrifice terms learning quality somewhere anything think sg picking right things whole traineeships graduating students may wish pursue studies unable actually see lot value apprenticeships alternative path people feel like conform traditional ones believe sg something similar united kingdom months apprenticeships lead apprentice trainee finish professional certification equivalent diploma degree related role emergence modern apprenticeship colleagues late taking apprenticeship compliment job functions well raise level soft hard skills doubt take time shift mentality masses many paths available students take compared traditional ones

We started with a focus on bio science and pharma, they somewhat filled the gap but with the new advent of tech companies setting up shop in Singapore from certain countries they are preparing another shift. They did try to be faster - now secondary school kids learn coding for a start.

Have to say, our certs probably only get our foot at the door for our first job. And it ends there. What we do from there as we climb is learnt on the job. I'll be truthful unker here graduated less than 10 years ago and most of the things I use for work and business are mostly outdated, and only less than 20% useful in this day.

If we are banging on just using our degree or diploma to get through your entire career, then, we might be making a mistake. 

There's a reason why continued learning, professional courses, and certified whatever exists so we can continually stay abreast. That should NOT be the responsibility of foundational education.

Discussion on the role educational institutions are failing to take,Dunkjoe,"Wow your thoughts nailed what I am trying to convey. 

1. Yes, in academic institutions and their examinations (N, O, A levels), rote learning is overemphasized over application of skills. This has been said in many places many times. Partly that could be why if you only have an A level cert (which is pretty hard to get), the only route you have is pretty much be a teacher or sign on (what I heard) because jobs typically search for people with practical skills. This should be a sign that those with A* and H3 subjects aren't even able to translate it to good jobs and good pay. That is unless you manage to get good grades in university as well, which might not necessarily be the case due to many many factors.


2. Yep, some projects are literally one man shows. But in real workplaces... This could happen too lolol.


3. Sadly, a lot of the things I learnt were outdated as well, especially in the last 10 years, where there were a lot of changes due to globalisation and technological advances.

The state of underemployment in Singapore,epimeliad,"The problem with trying to answer this question is that there is a lot to unpack with underemployment. As you mentioned there are 3 types here each arising from different market phenomenon.

In my view. If we consider underemployment as a mismatch with fresh grad expectations to companies demand, this would show an unrealistic expectations for fresh graduates. This issue is compounded as fresh grad do not have any experience in the labor market and hence hard to determine their worth. Salary reports are naturally skewed towards higher income and many fresh grad do not want to be earning less than the median salary, although by definition half of them will.

The second type of mismatch is graduates not being able to use their skills or be forced to do task below their skillset. This reflects a slack in the labor market. In this case we could view underemployment as a transitioning phase where once the labor market tighten, people will change jobs to one they are a better fit.

A closely related phenomenon with the above case is also the third set of underemployment where people want to work longer but are curtailed to shorter hours. Again we can see this is akin to taking a job where skills are not utilized fully. And thus could say this is a market failure, where graduates need to adjust once the market recovers.

Bearing in mind all 3 cases can exist concurrently and in fact do. Like any economy, correcting for market failure typically require external influence. In this case, more information for fresh grads, better job matching, and a change in attitude on job switching.",15,1597121458,11/8/2020 4:50,the problem with trying to answer this question is that there is a lot to unpack with underemployment as you mentioned there are  types here each arising from different market phenomenon  in my view if we consider underemployment as a mismatch with fresh grad expectations to companies demand this would show an unrealistic expectations for fresh graduates this issue is compounded as fresh grad do not have any experience in the labor market and hence hard to determine their worth salary reports are naturally skewed towards higher income and many fresh grad do not want to be earning less than the median salary although by definition half of them will  the second type of mismatch is graduates not being able to use their skills or be forced to do task below their skillset this reflects a slack in the labor market in this case we could view underemployment as a transitioning phase where once the labor market tighten people will change jobs to one they are a better fit  a closely related phenomenon with the above case is also the third set of underemployment where people want to work longer but are curtailed to shorter hours again we can see this is akin to taking a job where skills are not utilized fully and thus could say this is a market failure where graduates need to adjust once the market recovers  bearing in mind all  cases can exist concurrently and in fact do like any economy correcting for market failure typically require external influence in this case more information for fresh grads better job matching and a change in attitude on job switching,problem trying answer question lot unpack underemployment mentioned types arising different market phenomenon view consider underemployment mismatch fresh grad expectations companies demand would show unrealistic expectations fresh graduates issue compounded fresh grad experience labor market hence hard determine worth salary reports naturally skewed towards higher income many fresh grad want earning less median salary although definition half second type mismatch graduates able use skills forced task skillset reflects slack labor market case could view underemployment transitioning phase labor market tighten people change jobs one better fit closely related phenomenon case also third set underemployment people want work longer curtailed shorter hours see akin taking job skills utilized fully thus could say market failure graduates need adjust market recovers bearing mind cases exist concurrently fact like economy correcting market failure typically require external influence case information fresh grads better job matching change attitude job switching,,Neutral,problem trying answer question lot unpack underemployment mentioned types arising different market phenomenon view consider underemployment mismatch fresh grad expectations companies demand would show unrealistic expectations fresh graduates issue compounded fresh grad experience labor market hence hard determine worth salary reports naturally skewed towards higher income many fresh grad want earning less median salary although definition half second type mismatch graduates able use skills forced task skillset reflects slack labor market case could view underemployment transitioning phase labor market tighten people change jobs one better fit closely related phenomenon case also third set underemployment people want work longer curtailed shorter hours see akin taking job skills utilized fully thus could say market failure graduates need adjust market recovers bearing mind cases exist concurrently fact like economy correcting market failure typically require external influence case information fresh grads better job matching change attitude job switching

The state of underemployment in Singapore,Dunkjoe,"Thanks for being the first person who use all the 3 types of underemployment I mentioned in your reply! ... Though the order is reversed.


Let's begin with this statement. I think that fresh graduates face a huge issue, that is comparable with non-fresh graduates. Think about this scenario, if I'm a technician trying to move up to engineer role, but I don't have ""3 years of engineer experience"", am I going to stay as a technician forever? Or how about mid-career switchers? After retraining, they still won't have experience.

Some would say that fresh graduates lack not only experience, but soft skills or ""transferable skills"", but frankly, that's not hard to mediate. Training courses, whether in-house or external, whether self-paid or company-sponsored, or school-led initiatives willasily solve this issue.


Median salary might refer to a band of salaries, and not necessarily mean half. But I digress. There are salary guides for university grads depending on progression and results and so on, I don't think they are hard to understand what salary to offer, because there have been a few decades of fresh grads looking for work... Unless you are referring to a new industry with radically different skills from existing industries.


It depends on the industry, I think there is a slack in the labor market for some time in some industries. And age is an issue as well, so people might not be able to change jobs as easily as you think. And fresh grads would need additional assistance to find their first job, or else once they go into a different industry, it might be hard to return to the one they originally learnt, and thus be underemployed forever. A simple example is university grads driving grab full-time.


Um nope, I don't think this has to do with skills. It could be to do with company demand of manpower. Take the current COVID-19 situation affecting the airline industry and thus SIA has put many employees on furlough. They want to work but can't because market demand forced the company to reduce the number of hours worked by employees. There have been news of some companies reducing working days as well.

I agree, this is a market failure, and could recover once the market recovers. But some jobs might be lost forever.


You are right, but I sincerely hope that more can be done so graduates from any institution will be able to find long-lasting jobs that suit their profile, including skills learning proficiency, personality and so on. Yes, people can change their attitudes and so on, but people are not machines. We all have different personalities and tendencies, which is why horoscopes?MBTI etc. exist.

Recently, there are articles talking about how preparing students for the workforce has been, like some requiring them to go for internships before graduation. It's a move in the right direction and I hope more could be done so eventually a graduation ceremony is not the 'start of joblessness' for many students.

Lastly, there will definitely be market failures because of market intervention from time to time, especially in the last few months of Circuit Breaker. Correction needs to be fast and substantial to pull the free market back to work once lockdowns can be safely withdrawn. But for now, the domestic economy needs to expand at a fast pace in order to sustain the needs and wants of the 5.7 million people as of 2019 (as per Singstat).

The state of underemployment in Singapore,Dunkjoe,"Yep actually I am just citing pre-COVID data.

By simple inference, one can guess that the current situation and post-COVID situation will be much worse for underemployment.

But given how the focus is more on unemployment and seemingly trying to keep people off the NEET (Not uin Education, Employment, or Training) path seems to be the utmost priority. And in that fervor, it is actually pushing people towards underemployment. In extraordinary circumstances like now, I can understand that is is inevitable. 

What I'm concerned however is that this situation already seems systematic and widespread before COVID-19. 

I'm actually very surprised as well because every once in a while I hear young people I know getting out of work and unable to find a job for months. And those are in their 20s, which is alarming because a few of them are not the having 'atas expectations' type, they just want to find a job from a course they studied in.

The state of underemployment in Singapore,Dunkjoe,"Thanks for your perspective.

You are right, people have different choices and preferences, whether in life or career progression.

I am concerned about people who have chosen the best choices they are offered with, yet are suffering from systematic (not arbitrary or figurative) factors that limit their potential in life.

And as with what I mentioned as the 3 types of underemployment, the first type (which is unable to find a full-time job) can be looked into and legislated more easily. After all, full-time jobs cover all industries, whether it be F&B, cleaning or the retail industry. 

Also, I know that the F&B, tourism and hospitality industries have long been a place for lowly-educated and people with special needs to work in. These are the industries that are severely impacted by COVID-19. I do believe it is important to focus on displaced workers, especially those which are more vulnerable, in order to prevent type 3 underemployment.

Legislation might not be the best choice to solve such problems, what's more important is to strengthen the social net and inform the people and organisations who have the power to help, to help. Like for example, NGOs.

Forcing companies to do stuff should be reserved for very dire situations, and now is not the time.... yet.",-1,1597119281,11/8/2020 4:14,thanks for your perspective  you are right people have different choices and preferences whether in life or career progression  i am concerned about people who have chosen the best choices they are offered with yet are suffering from systematic not arbitrary or figurative factors that limit their potential in life  and as with what i mentioned as the  types of underemployment the first type which is unable to find a fulltime job can be looked into and legislated more easily after all fulltime jobs cover all industries whether it be fb cleaning or the retail industry   also i know that the fb tourism and hospitality industries have long been a place for lowlyeducated and people with special needs to work in these are the industries that are severely impacted by  i do believe it is important to focus on displaced workers especially those which are more vulnerable in order to prevent type  underemployment  legislation might not be the best choice to solve such problems what is more important is to strengthen the social net and inform the people and organisations who have the power to help to help like for example ngos  forcing companies to do stuff should be reserved for very dire situations and now is not the time yet,thanks perspective right people different choices preferences whether life career progression concerned people chosen best choices offered yet suffering systematic arbitrary figurative factors limit potential life mentioned types underemployment first type unable find fulltime job looked legislated easily fulltime jobs cover industries whether fb cleaning retail industry also know fb tourism hospitality industries long place lowlyeducated people special needs work industries severely impacted believe important focus displaced workers especially vulnerable order prevent type underemployment legislation might best choice solve problems important strengthen social net inform people organisations power help help like example ngos forcing companies stuff reserved dire situations time yet,,Neutral,thanks perspective right people different choices preferences whether life career progression concerned people chosen best choices offered yet suffering systematic arbitrary figurative factors limit potential life mentioned types underemployment first type unable find fulltime job looked legislated easily fulltime jobs cover industries whether fb cleaning retail industry also know fb tourism hospitality industries long place lowlyeducated people special needs work industries severely impacted believe important focus displaced workers especially vulnerable order prevent type underemployment legislation might best choice solve problems important strengthen social net inform people organisations power help help like example ngos forcing companies stuff reserved dire situations time yet
The state of underemployment in Singapore,Dunkjoe,"The gig economy pays better but everyone knows that it isn't likely a long-term job, like one that you can work to old age.

I think the mismatch comes because there usually is a range for any full-time permanent job position, and also whatever salary you accept could be a basis for your future job salaries. 

So yea, some people might find it hard to increase their salary if they start from a low base, especially their first jobs.

I don't think this describes reality. The fact of the matter is that there's significant underemployment in certain sectors, while other sectors (IT is a commonly cited example and is mentioned even in this thread) are having trouble even hiring enough staff. If everyone is making optimal and rational decisions, in the economic sense, why is this even happening? At the end of the day, people have preferences, and certain career paths are more attractive for various reasons. The market compensates by reducing salaries lower in these career paths as per supply and demand, and basic microeconomics suggests that in those career paths there will be an oversupply that will not be met by demand.

Of course, I am not dismissing underemployment as a problem. It is a problem that affects every economy, including ours, and possible solutions are very much worth discussing. I just don't think it makes any sense to buy into the mentality that those who are underemployed are often pure victims suffering grand injustice that they could not have avoided.",-2,1597186635,11/8/2020 22:57, i do not think this describes reality the fact of the matter is that there is significant underemployment in certain sectors while other sectors it is a commonly cited example and is mentioned even in this thread are having trouble even hiring enough staff if everyone is making optimal and rational decisions in the economic sense why is this even happening at the end of the day people have preferences and certain career paths are more attractive for various reasons the market compensates by reducing salaries lower in these career paths as per supply and demand and basic microeconomics suggests that in those career paths there will be an oversupply that will not be met by demand  of course i am not dismissing underemployment as a problem it is a problem that affects every economy including ours and possible solutions are very much worth discussing i just do not think it makes any sense to buy into the mentality that those who are underemployed are often pure victims suffering grand injustice that they could not have avoided,think describes reality fact matter significant underemployment certain sectors sectors commonly cited example mentioned even thread trouble even hiring enough staff everyone making optimal rational decisions economic sense even happening end day people preferences certain career paths attractive various reasons market compensates reducing salaries lower career paths per supply demand basic microeconomics suggests career paths oversupply met demand course dismissing underemployment problem problem affects every economy including possible solutions much worth discussing think makes sense buy mentality underemployed often pure victims suffering grand injustice could avoided,,Neutral,think describes reality fact matter significant underemployment certain sectors sectors commonly cited example mentioned even thread trouble even hiring enough staff everyone making optimal rational decisions economic sense even happening end day people preferences certain career paths attractive various reasons market compensates reducing salaries lower career paths per supply demand basic microeconomics suggests career paths oversupply met demand course dismissing underemployment problem problem affects every economy including possible solutions much worth discussing think makes sense buy mentality underemployed often pure victims suffering grand injustice could avoided

The state of underemployment in Singapore,skatyboy,"Because university isn't supposed to be the place you go to to get ready for workforce. If you want to learn workforce skills, it's vocational education like polytechniques /ITE/ WSQ. However, Singaporeans have made these qualifications ""inferior"" to a degree, but by virtue of the outcomes of vocational training, it's really to prepare people for specialised skills in the workforce. Which is why there isn't a Computer Science diploma, it's Information Technology, which is an application of CS to the world.

Universities are tasked to teach the theories and concepts, not the tools of the trade. Concepts and theories are timeless (or at least, slowly changing due to the rigorous academic nature of making a theory into one), tools are not. It's like expecting a degree in Biology to teach you how to use this new-fangled microscope. A civil engineering degree to teach you how to use a concrete cube testing machine. Yes, a Polytechnic / ITE course might do that, but not in uni. university would teach you WHY concrete testing is important, for instance.

It's your responsibility to utilise the skills/ knowledge that the university teaches you to learn and get up to speed with technology, hence why critical thinking is important. When a CS prof teaches you memoization, you won't use memoization libraries/ framework blindly like a drone. CS prof teaches you the theory X (which has been around for ages) and you see the Python processing library and go, ""so this function would allow me to do theory X"".

This is the reason why Singaporeans lack critical thinking skills. They expect knowledge to be spoon-fed like as though they are mindless drones.

Going back to my FAANG post, FAANGs don't give a damn about what tools you know. In fact, you won't be able to know the tools they are using, since most of them are internally built tools /libraries (i.e. you need to work at Google to know how to use Google's tools). Their interviews are more or less along the lines of knowledge of theory and not practice, testing if you understand the concepts in CS.

Of course not. The PAP's policies and views are rarely fully original too.

But it is in our interest for opposing views to be raised in parliament, so that the government responds to them and their response is recorded.

The author seems to have missed the elephant in the room, which is the ability of the PAP to amend the Constitution at will. I don't think I need to explain why this is a problem.


This problem is a problem that should be solved by educating voters so that they understand that the decisions being made are good, and why they are good. A good government should be able to do this. Wouldn't you agree?

It is not solved by what is basically fear-mongering and making Singaporeans worry we'll get a bad government in future.


New Zealand. South Korea. Taiwan.

By the way, none of those governments had a ""strong mandate"" like the PAP did.


The opposition didn't do that. Any sensible opposition would let the government go ahead in a crisis, and you can see that the Workers' Party did do that.

It's also not the relief funds that people are criticising now. It's how they handled the migrant worker situation.


Let's look at the experience of the people in the [Multi-Ministry Task Force]

- Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Health. Previously, civil servant. Educated in electrical engineering.
- Lawrence Wong, Minister for Nat'l Development. Previously, civil servant. Educated in economics.
- Heng Swee Keat, DPM. Previously, civil servant. Educated in economics.
- Iswaran, Minister for Communications and Information. Previously, business executive. Educated in economics.
- Chan Chun Sing, Minister for Trade and Industry. Previously, SAF officer. Educated in economics.
- Masagos, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources. Previously, business executive. Educated in EEE.
- Ng Chee Meng, Minister in PMO and Sec-gen NTUC. Previously, SAF officer. Educated in EE.
- Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Education. Previously, civil servant. Educated in economics.
- Josephine Teo, Minister for Manpower. Previously, business executive. Educated in Economics.
- Desmond Lee, Minister for Social and Family Development. Previously, lawyer/prosecutor. Educated in law.
- Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Transport. Currently also a doctor.

Do any of these people in particular have any special experience that you think the opposition cannot provide?

Are There Really No Singaporeans Who Can Do These Jobs?,snookajam,"I work in the technolog or finance sector and heres my opinion on the tech side. 

Technology is definitely a hot area that is still expanding - my friends in tech are all able to move around and find new job offers in this environment. Some roles may be slowly phased out or become outsourced overseas, but overall the demand is still there. You probably hear of many people trying to do mid-career switch by taking those General Assembly courses, online courses. These qualify you for pretty much only the entry level role. The point is that to fill up the experienced roles, many companies have to get foreigners to fill up the numbers. Some are taken by Singaporeans who are experienced in the IT field, but theres still a large number remaining that the Chinese or Indians will take. 

If you are underemployed or unemployed and trying to get a job in the IT industry, chances are you are simply not skilled enough. Maybe there is some degree of companies not being willing to take in people without experience, but surely you also know of friends who have hustled hard enough to build up a solid portfolio and land themselves in AAA companies.

Are There Really No Singaporeans Who Can Do These Jobs?,Pandacius,"Aye. I work in research and development. We have to hire the best. In research, you can't just replace 1 brilliant scientist with 10 mediocre ones. To develop the top learning algorithms and have a chance of competing in the global stage, we need to identity PhD graduates from top research groups around the world and hire them. And yes, there are Singaporeans amoung these, and they are the first people we hire. We literally know them all!

The problem is SG is small. If you want someone - say, who knows quantum machine learning directly from the top group in MIT, then there is 1 Singaporean who fits the bill. So we hire him immediately, but we still need at least 5 more!

Now we have a choice, we either hire foreigners so we can compete. Or we either relocate or crash and burn.

If we do the latter. Then that 1 brilliant Singaporean we hired wouldn't even have a place to work in SG - he wouldn't be able to return home. Meanwhile, all our support staff and the jobs our employees indirectly support - will all vanish.

I am getting really disturbed these days reading all the anti-foreign sentiment. Employment is \*not\* a zero-sum game! When a company headquarters in SG, they bring external revenue to SG. This revenue, when used to pay employees in SG - even if they are foreigners, will end up circulating in the SG economy. Our employees need to eat, need to go to movies, need to travel, need to use Singaporean banks to invest. That money ends up creating more jobs.

Meanwhile, by having companies headquarter here, the really brilliant Singaporeans can return home. I mean, Singaporean is very lucky to have this.

Is it me or society is becoming a narration of us vs them?,startrekmind,"I think society has always been this way because people tend to take a âI know bestâ approach, regardless of the objective reality. You have foreign talents who think they know best without trying to understand the local market, and locals who think they know best without trying to learn from different mentalities. You have the boomers who think they know best based on their experiences without understanding that times and attitudes have changed significantly, and millennials who think they know best based on how outdated the boomers are without learning from some things that might still hold true.

Protectionist agendas have also always been around but social media has definitely helped to encourage them, especially since the newsfeed algorithms tend to create echo chambers. I am a Hong Kong Chinese but grew up in Singapore. While most of my Singaporean friends regard me as an honorary Singaporean (often with a âWhat you talking? You Singapore one la!â), when I disagree with the criticism that some of my fairweather friends have about Singapore, I am reminded that to them, my âbelongingâ is conditional and that if I were to work in Singapore, they'd count me as an FT who's come to snatch jobs from locals.

Will big events arise from this trend? It's highly possible, especially if we don't learn from history. After all, one of the last times there was fanatical levels of populism (in Nazi Germany), we ended up with World War 2.

Management wise, itâs cheaper to hire foreigners. Reasons as to why to hire locals include:
- to fulfil the government quota, in order to hire more foreigners
- Iâll get an incentive if I hire enough locals
- because the skill level required cannot be provided by foreigners (which, if youâd just need to get the job done, can just get another foreigner)

As long as thereâs a minority, there will be some form of racism. No matter how âenlightenedâ the country is. 

It stems from how different races were treated and viewed from ages ago. 

What we can do as individuals is to pass the right message to the next generation change. I believe the solution will be a generational one. And not what we will experience in our lifetimes. 

Eg. My grandmother used to tell me and my cousins that the apunehneh will come and catch us if we misbehave. My cousins will never say the same thing as my grandmother. 

This effect will hopefully spill over to the generation and beyond.

Iâve been in this country for 22 years now and nothing has really changed. Why do people feel the need to say racist things to strangers all the time?,LookAtItGo123,"Racism is a taught behaviour, like it or not, people learn consciously and subconsciously. And like this virus, it does spread without most people noticing. The guy who pmed you has most likely merged a couple of his bad experiences with the usual media portrayal of stereotypes (looking at you mediacorpse) and can no longer differentiate reality from made up imaginary scenarios. And yes while it does not excuse his behavior, it is very clear to see that we never had racial harmony, only racial tolerance.

But is racial harmony truly dead? Not entirely. You still see people who help others regardless of colour. You still see christians and chinese helping our muslim brothers and making them feel safe to practice their religion (it was during an incident a few years back) you still see kids playing with each other and not being too bothered by it. So what sets the difference and how can we make it work?

One extreme example was when a friend told me that sheâd not want to be intimate with certain races because sheâll be polluted.. and this was coming from a young educated woman. Itâs completely insane, and I donât see why other Chinese donât see this as an issue..

I would say for most part Singapore is easy going doesn't really care for much more than the size of your wallet. Interracial couples are common sight in most malls. 

Singapore government runs a two track system when it comes to dealing with discrimination. 

Track 1:By itself it is more or less non discriminatory and takes a heavy handed approach to online or offline abuse, racism.

Track 2: Close one/both eyes to racism in terms of employment opps and career progression. 

Ads for ""Chinese speaking"" (code word for Chinese only applicants ! If you do not believe apply as Malay or Indian claim to speak Chinese it's been tried before. In fact, you can apply as Indonesian or Thai Chinese with zero Mandarin knowledge, the requirement vanishes too!), reports of human resource not even opening resumes of minority races - send them straight to trash, anecdotal evidences of management ranks filled with Chinese with only a few clerks and janitors among minority races etc. are very common. 

There are also reports of minority kids being ""marked down"" right from school, although I do not believe them to be true as I know personally several Indian friends' kids that shine bright, get scholarships etc.

I think these take time to change. Singapore has moved too fast from 3rd world to 1st and there's lot of in means ity so all parts have not moved at same pace.

Oddly enough, Singapore Chinese are extremely sensitive to minor slights and even non-verbal ""racism"" such as served late in restaurants, when they are in australia or Europe, often complain loudly (when they are back home of course)

Sad to say, these recent few years have seen quite a few very negative events, not just at foreigners but singaporeans too. Especially doxxing incidents like those involving Xiaxue or the guy who road raged.

It might be hard for me to acknowledge but I know some people who are here on a work permit while some others are PRs/ citizens. Most were ok prior to the COVID-19 crisis, but there was a wave of anti-foreigner sentiment, whether PR/ citizen or otherwise due to the view that they are stealing Singaporeans' jobs. 

During the COVID-19 crisis, early on there was discrimination against Wuhan people, and later to a lesser extent, generally anyone from China. And recently, there has been harassment against a few indians, like the harassment of a guy who didn't wear his mask.

But who am I kidding? Discrimination is like a double-edged sword. Just as how some discriminate, some Singaporeans got discriminated against like the one in UK.

For me, I generally have an open attitude and would urge all people, native or not, to do the same. For the saying goes, do to others as you would want others to do to you. Live and let live.

For the guy in your edits, I think just ignore the troll. Some people have too much time and want to see others suffer.

I am sick of such people. They will always sprout cynically âyou are having a good lifeâ as if we donât deserve to due to our race or religion or age.

They pushed on conversations which meant the same thing - they didnât get a âgood lifeâ as mine and I do so somehow âunfairlyâ.

my parents deride malays and indians but claim they aren't being racist. I asked them why is it the case - their reply essentially boiled down to ""we don't mean to hate on them for no reason but it is our life observations."" it is human nature to form stereotypes and distill everything into simple terms but sometimes human nature is just plainly wrong. and until our government can open freer discourse on race and scrap ling ling ali bala and george from our ""national education"" and get sham to stop swinging his kebab around I don't forsee people moving past this flawed instinct.",44,1589027114,9/5/2020 12:25, would make that most chinese singaporeans tbh said it before but our government conflates the very wide umbrella of racism with racial riots from  what anymore only if you make a facebook post slandering malays and happen to be a ntuc manager are you considered to be a racist in our government is eyes so everything else gets a free pass and we can go on laughing at the us or malaysia for being soooo racist and backwards   my parents deride malays and indians but claim they are not being racist i asked them why is it the case  their reply essentially boiled down to we do not mean to hate on them for no reason but it is our life observations it is human nature to form stereotypes and distill everything into simple terms but sometimes human nature is just plainly wrong and until our government can open freer discourse on race and scrap ling ling ali bala and george from our national education and get sham to stop swinging his kebab around i do not forsee people moving past this flawed instinct,would make chinese singaporeans tbh said government conflates wide umbrella racism racial riots anymore make facebook post slandering malays happen ntuc manager considered racist government eyes everything else gets free pass go laughing us malaysia soooo racist backwards parents deride malays indians claim racist asked case reply essentially boiled mean hate reason life observations human nature form stereotypes distill everything simple terms sometimes human nature plainly wrong government open freer discourse race scrap ling ling ali bala george national education get sham stop swinging kebab around forsee people moving past flawed instinct,,Neutral,would make chinese singaporeans tbh said government conflates wide umbrella racism racial riots anymore make facebook post slandering malays happen ntuc manager considered racist government eyes everything else gets free pass go laughing us malaysia soooo racist backwards parents deride malays indians claim racist asked case reply essentially boiled mean hate reason life observations human nature form stereotypes distill everything simple terms sometimes human nature plainly wrong government open freer discourse race scrap ling ling ali bala george national education get sham stop swinging kebab around forsee people moving past flawed instinct

This is also because the same narrative has been pushed for years in Singapore - that our diversity is a weakness and not a strength, racial harmony is fragile and if Singaporeans of different races are incapable of mixing with each other without state intervention (see HDB ethnic mix quotas, our ""reserved' presidential election and how Singapore is not ready for a non-chinese PM). This racism has also been made worse because of our immigration policy - we've welcomed immigrants too fast with no thought given as to whether they would be able to assimilate into Singapore society. It's not enough that someone comes from China or India - ethnicity not equal to culture, e.g. Chinese from  people's republic of china  clearly behave very differently from Chinese from say, Malaysia because they've grown up in a homogenous country where they are clearly and overwhelmingly the dominant race/culture so much so that there is no real need to consider the very small minority. And yet, signs were not read and with social media people become more aware of the means in which immigrants are courted - see CECA and MOE scholarships, for example. At the same time, our infrastructure wasn't ready to handle such a surge, see how housing, transport and other services have suffered. The cumulative effect of all of this is a growing sense amongst Singaporeans that we are being crowded out of our own country by people who are so culturally different from us and our quality of life is decreasing, resulting in the ugliness that is xenophobia and racism. This is not something that is out of the norm in more homogenous societies - see europe - but it is worrying for a non-homogenous one like us.

To me, the most damming incident was this - remember the huge fuss kicked up by Singaporeans over the filipino embassy wanting to celebrate Philippines' indepedence day at Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza? It was so bad that it had to be cancelled over ""safety and security concerns"". Can you imagine the outcry and indignity if the same thing happened to us overseas? Its utterly disgraceful, and it isn't just xenophobia - it smacks of racial arrogance. Call me cynical but i doubt too many would've protested if the event was ANZAC day or the Japanese Emperor's birthday. Change my mind. To give another example, our government runs Singapore day in different countries - not once have we been forced to cancel it due to protests from citizens of the country. Can you imagine the outcry if it did happen?

tl;dr as long as there isn't a proper conversation on these topics, and a reliance on the state to engineer racial harmony, racism and xenophobia will only continue to grow because there's no real incentive (beyond the threat of coercion by government) to nip it in the bud.

That's because Malays are culturally not ambitious people. Malays themselves will explain to you why their own culture is not as ambitious as the Indians and the Chinese. Malaysia Malays have every advantage in their own country and are still...., not doing the best in their own country. And it's just because..., they don't desire material wealth. 

Is that racism? Certain cultures are just more chillax and laid back, and may not be suitable for certain lines of work especially in a rat race situation where it's very competitive and high pressured.

I don't necessarily agree with the remark about Malays being less ambitious. But at some point reasons such as ""sociopolitical structures"" become so closely intertwined with ""culture"" this argument degenerates into linguistic nitpicking. 

*Cultures are different*. Any these differences make a difference in a person's behavior. Anyone who has had a sufficient number of foreign (or local-but-minority-race) friends can tell you this. As will anyone who has spent a reasonable amount of time abroad. It is absurd, almost dishonest to argue that different cultures are *not* predisposed to certain behaviors.

Talk to a Chinese national and he's very likely to be more trusting, respectful of authorities. Talk to an American and he'll tell you an entirely different perspective. And trust me, if you have interacted with either on a personal level, you *will* take this into account in your interactions. For your own sake.

Of course, you can shrug this off and attribute this difference to the different historical paths (or sociopolitical structures) taken by both countries, or cultures if you will.

Look the OP argument is simply this ""democracies help to temper racism"" to which I argue it doesn't because authoritarian countries are successful too and there exist democracies that are unable to stop the spread of racism. Which leads to my point that there exist no relationship between the 2 variables. 

I don't see how this is an insane point.
