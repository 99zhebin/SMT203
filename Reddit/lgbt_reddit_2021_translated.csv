Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,wildheart38,"Whats new? Just another day in this first world on the outside third world on the inside country. 

I actually have alot of respect for Min (HA and Law). I dont really blame him for making this statement which - frankly - is a non-statement. One man alone, no matter how powerful or smart, cannot unilaterally change the law. You can lobby for all you want, but the civil service is full of religious zealots and homophobes at every rank possible. You can write a brilliant policy paper which may only slightly be pro-LGBT, but I can assure you that it wouldn’t pass the clearance chain. 

People tell me to always consider the views of those you disagree with, because its the mark of maturity and paves the way for a potentially fruitful discussion/action. But I cannot agree with something that is so inherently wrong and attacks a part of my identity. 

Discounting the religious homophobes and boomers, its extremely sad and disappointing that there are homophobic atheists in their 20s and 30s. I feel very tempted to hear their reasons but I am not sure if I am prepared for the stupidity that inevitably comes along. 

Homophobia is as wrong as racism or condemning inter-racial unions.

So if a man and woman comes together out of pure love, but does not procreate (due to medical reasons or voluntarily) does that mean that the union is invalid and subject to condemnation?",28,1619327960,2021-04-25 05:19:20,"Whats new?

At least in my opinion it's easier to change their minds since the rejection of religion might have similarities to this. Basically me.

Points that changed my mind.

1. You can't turn gay because there are gay people. Hey people who claim it turns straight people gay, can you? Me? I'm straight, never gonna change. Maybe you turn gay who knows. 

2. If a gay man confesses to me, I'll reject him like a normal freaking person. Me straight, never going to change. He like me then like lo, nothing will happen anyway.

3. Dun nosy other ppl business. Ur mother never teach you properly.

4. Lgbt is not some sort of threat. At the very least just mind your own business and ignore. Go disturb other ppl for fuck. Unless point 1 apply to you haha.

Be confident in your straightness for fucks sake. Why so scared

I became neutral after learning about these points. But over the years the more I see rich and powerful busybody eat full nothing to do, try to disturb lgbt ppl for no reason, the more I support them."

Then move over and enjoy your life there. As much as Singapore is such a good country, it’s a pity that there’s still a huge anti-lgbtqia sentiment here. Also, if you have the ability to contest 377A, go for it. I will admire you.

Indeed, after the last election, there was even harder pushback from this group on the PAP for electing candidates that look like they could be LGBT.

I further suspect, but have no proof, that support for LGBT rights is correlated with wealth/income.  The more settled you are, the more headspace you have to be concerned with LGBT rights vs basic needs such as food, shelter etc.  Some of the uncles on the group are asking why any funds are going to LGBT when there are ""other people in need.""

I know plenty of people who aren't exactly LGBT friendly (either implied or directly so), and almost none of them are religious folks. In fact, some of them are as against religion as they are against LGBT.

It's entirely possible, in fact even common, to take conservative positions without being very religious. After all, Asian countries are still rather conservative in general.

But some may argue that it's still a good idea to focus on the extreme demographic, because they are the ones who have been actively campaigning against LGBT rights - the loud minority, one can put it. That, and the silent non-supporters are tougher to focus one, because they are, well, silent,",131,1619320350,2021-04-25 03:12:30,"The religious are a convenient lightning rod.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,btcprox,"I also agree that there's definitely a portion of locals who harbor homophobic ideas that aren't based in religion.

I reckon quite a bit of it has to do with the idea of the tight bundling of romance + sex + procreation, that couples should get together for the ultimate goal of raising biological children. Then same-gender couples end up flying in the face of that idea, because *obviously* they can't have biological offspring together. 

Plus there's that additional idea of heterosexual parent couples somehow being the only effective parenting presence for children because of the apparent availability of masculinity + feminity (which is pretty harsh on single parents)

Another idea might just simply be that people think too much about the possibility of anal penetration. Seriously. Lesbian couples don't get as much flak because it's fetishized by straight men, but gay male couples are an affront because clearly the only way they'd have sex is up the butt (not true)",61,1619320788,2021-04-25 03:19:48,"I also agree that there's definitely a portion of locals who harbor homophobic ideas that aren't based in religion.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,A_Watchful_Voyeur,"The LGBT community like to use US talking point when push back against the Anti-LGBT people. It might be true in the US as anti-LGBT community is largely christian conservatives but our demographic is different, we have Buddhist conservatives, muslim conservatives even non conservative people might not subscribed to the liberal ideology of the LGBT.

The LGBT community in the US is currently singling out Abrahamic religion and the west as the source of all  ""homophobic"" ideology, claiming the other cultures were not ""homophobic"". By doing they are trying to make it look like LGBT is a norm in the past and ""homophobia"" is a recent ideology created by the Abrahamic religion. It gives LGBT community legitimacy and create illusion that the other culture and religion are on their side. However When these LGBT talking points spread from the west to the east it dosen't really hold up to the reality.

In reality, ancient culture such as the Chinese do not have formal law to prosecute LGBT people, but LGBT act it is much frown upon. Emperor that like to play with boys are view as irresponsible, Opera actors cross dressed because female are not allow to work as actoress, Aristocrat hired underage boy toy for their ""luxurious entertainment"".  Same sex sexual act is practice among people who are rich and powerful and are they are viewed as corrupted group.

Only very few literature talk about same sex relationship and among these literature many of it were just over-interpretation of friendship, which those LGBT scholars are stretching it to fit their agenda. The idea of same sex relation in the past is very much different from the current interpretation of LGBT. In the past it is normal for friends to hold hands, writing poem about how they miss their friend.
There is even a tribe in papua new Guinea which boy has to drink semen of the elders during the coming of age ceremony. Is this also means that they support LGBT? 

The definition of LGBT become blurred when used across culture and time. So many of the supposed LGBT of the ancient time is not really included into the definition of LGBT.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,TheOnceAndFutureZing,"This is gonna sound very cynical, but it ultimately boils down to how much benefit can be derived from going against the conservative majority.

For the casinos, the arithmetic was that the boost to the economy and country's international profile would result in more votes for the ruling party in the longer-term. Remember that a big part of the PAP's mandate has been their success at delivering economic prosperity. Some portion of the conservation opposition could also be mollified putting in restrictions for locals visiting the casinos etc.

For 377A, it's more unclear. You can't mollify the conservative opposition because the issue is ultimately a binary one. There's no obvious economic or social benefit to be garnered either because they don't actively enforce the law in the first place. I personally think that the PAP will garner more votes long-term by repealing 377A, but clearly they see no rush to commit to that because none of the other major parties have come out in support of repealing it. Perhaps they also think that it's not gonna win them a lot of goodwill from younger voters either because their other behaviours (e.g. gerrymandering, gutter politics, the Reserved Presidency, etc) have already alienated them past the point where a repeal alone would do any good. 

The 100% pragmatic thing to do is to wait till (i) the conservative boomers die out and the public sentiment shifts (see the IPSOS survey where the majority surveyed were still against repeal); or (ii) one of the other major parties makes it a political issue, forcing the PAP to re-evaluate their position on the matter.",25,1619339219,2021-04-25 08:26:59,"This is gonna sound very cynical, but it ultimately boils down to how much benefit can be derived from going against the conservative majority.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,mrwagga,"I don’t disagree with Min Shan’s perspective either. He is a politician who must say politician things. 

I do however always question why people in this forum, even those purporting to be supportive of repeal, always jump to concede that there is majority support for non-repeal in Singapore to the extent that it matters enough to retain an explicitly unenforced law that bastardizes the legal system and circumscribes the personhood of a significant portion of the population.

At best we as a people disagree with homosexuals to the degree we disagree about many unsanctioned activities in the country including pre-marital sex, adultery or gambling. These are moral issues for sure but we are still able to recognize that the state is not responsible for the policing of social mores that arguably are not anyone’s business. 

A sample survey showing a tiny majority agreeing with an unjust law is not a good argument for any such law, let alone one that expressly subjugates the right to happiness of people with immutable traits.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,zambazzar,"Can our police really enforce every single law? Short of enforcing an extreme and draconian brother eye regime? It's the government's prerogative to decide which policies it wants to enforce at the end of the day.

(I am not gay but I have a decent amount of homosexual and transgender friends, and I support them, just to put it out there.) 

They are allowed to live their private lives with whomever they choose to be with as it pleases them. I could tell you that I know that homosexual acts are being committed when I see my friend going to the toilet in the gay club with a stranger. I don't see the police hanging around waiting to catch someone in the act, and I wouldn't want to see that happen either

This is not so much a legislatural issue, and from a legal sense, they can still use the law to prosecute say, a man who decides to rape another straight man by spiking his drink and sodomising him. I think that's terribly wrong, and that happened not long ago in the UK with that Indonesian guy who raped at least 206 men, with most of the men having been roofied under the false pretenses that he was nice while they were inebriated. If we don't have such a law, how would we ever, if such a case pops up, defend these men who have been raped and when it goes against their sexual orientation/identity? It would be unjust to remove the law and have these perpetrators only be tried for rape. I believe it was only last year that the penal code was revised to make rape gender neutral (can't be arsed to check now I'm outside on my phone, corrsct me if I'm wrong)

You're right, but I'm not sure why we're sidestepping that the opposition to LGBT rights amongst the Abrahamic religions is close to double that of those with no religion (~80% to ~45%; ~60% for Buddhists/Taoists/Hindus).

Why did NLB allow books to be destroyed because of a petition started by a certain religion? The same goes for HPB and its removal of a FAQ on human sexuality.

>Thank you for attending the Tech Forum over the weekend and for asking a salient question. You may recall that I made the following points. 
“First, that this is an old law that we inherited from the British. Second, that we don’t enforce this law – we respect the privacy of consenting adults in the bedroom. 
“Third, we really want to avoid the ‘culture wars’ that we see elsewhere on this polarising issue. We are not likely to achieve consensus by prolonged arguments. Fourth, this is not the central issue of our time. Our focus is to welcome talented Singaporeans like you if relevant opportunities arise. 
“Even if we disagree, we should live and let live in mutual respect. Best wishes for your future. PS: I did not use the word ‘silly’. I think you misheard me.”

Things like these take time to change because it’s not just changing the opinion of one or two people, it’s a big portion of the people. I’m sure if you go back 20-30 years. You’ll be met with a staggering majority of people that are vehemently anti gay - they find it unnatural etc. 

It’s only in recent years (5(?) years +) where the whole pro gay movement in Singapore specifically really began to pickup. 

The government isn’t a magical all powerful entity, sure you can attribute almost every single bad thing that happens to Singapore to the government, similar to how every single negative thing you’ve ever done in your life could be attributed to your parents doing a bad job bringing you up, but that’s not very fair isn’t it? 

I believe the homophobic people of Singapore have to take the L for this case. They’re the ones that are at fault, but it’s heartening because Singapore as a whole seems to be moving towards a generally pro gay culture. 

TLDR: not everything is gahmen’s fault. It’s a culture thing, and society will take time to improve. Singapore is getting there, just not yet.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,zambazzar,"That's not the point I was making, I do know the tragic effects and trust issues that develop from sexual assault on both men and women. However, I can't speak from a LGBTQ point of view due to the fact that I'm not LGBTQ. I was not talking about rape being any less harmful, rape is rape and abhorrent regardless of who did it to who. 

I am saying that if anything, being gay still has a stigma that the conservative folks here seem to give a big stink eye to, and I advocate stronger punishments for rapists who sodomise their victims regardless of their victims sexual orientation. Rules like 377A would definitely be enforced in such attacks of men on unknowing or drugged men and make that punishment even more severe than it would be on a woman, and thus, I am in favour of keeping it, since it is not enforced on the men who engage in homosexual acts in their own comfort and at home. 

To make it even clearer, I dare say that a straight man who is raped by another man would be even more stigmatised against and laughed at. The issue of men raping gay men and straight men come with their own issues, reducing own their sense of perceived masculinity, while the gay community would at least come together and comfort their brother who was a victim of such an abhorrent act. There'll simply never be a right answer since these things matter differently and subjectively to the two different men in this hypothetical situation, and there's no 100% definite way of telling how either man would take it, as there's too many variables. Your point of romantic relationships for straight men isn't set in stone either, what if he sees a homoerotic image or video, or even an act in front of him and suffers ptsd? Some female victims can't view sex scenes on TV because it reminds them of their trauma. It's simply unfair to just judge it based on future romantic prospects.

From the way you phrased that, I assume you are within this group of <25 year olds. When I was < 25 years old it also felt the same way to me that the large majority of people around my age group supported repealing 377A but quite a few years later things are exactly the same as they were in terms of public sentiment. What you feel based on the people around you is not the same as general public sentiment. In fact your own data shows that <50% of 18-25 feel that homosexual sex is not wrong.

\> Then again, I don't see why laws that restrict the rights of others are  being based on what the majority wants. If a majority supports  xenophobic or racist laws, our government's going to implement them too? 

Actually yes, that is theoretically the idea behind the democracy. Or if the current government doesn't want to implement, a different government that will implement the will of the people will eventually be voted in. Of course in practice that isn't how it usually works, and governments will usually take a stand on the issue after taking into account public sentiment. But saying that public sentiment should be ignored in a democracy runs counter to the point of a democracy.

Also ""laws that restrict the rights of others"" is a very broad term. For example the rights of smokers have been getting more and more limited with less public spaces where smoking is legal and even designated smoking zones, and I can pretty confidently say the public is supportive of this.

Of course, I agree with this. I am pointing out however that the government statements have a normalization effect on the acceptance of Singapore as generally not gay-friendly. And eventually people accept what they view as inevitable. 

The underlying point then is that these government statements aren't as harmless as some suggest they are.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,anakinmcfly,"> Rules like 377A would definitely be enforced in such attacks of men on unknowing or drugged men and make that punishment even more severe than it would be on a woman

This is the part I have issue with. For various reasons, the emotional and psychological fallout can be greater for female victims (e.g. due to women being less able to fight back, higher chance of being murdered after being raped, more likely to be questioned when reporting and accused of asking for it or leading him on, being further sexually harassed by men if the case goes public, etc). In comparison, having one’s masculinity insulted is not enough to surpass all those things, and is also usually the least of the male victims’ concerns after being raped (by men or women).

> while the gay community would at least come together and comfort their brother who was a victim of such an abhorrent act

Possibly but not always, especially since the kind of gay men who are targeted tend to be those who are not very popular or may have other issues (e.g. autism). The confident ones with lots of friends are less likely to become victims, same as with women (and straight men). And if the rapist is also gay and more loved and popular than his victim, the victim might not dare to speak out.

Male survivors as a whole greatly lack support and that’s a problem. It’s also something that should be addressed at the social or community level, rather than creating greater penalties for men who hurt men. What message would that send to female survivors - including lesbians - or men who were raped by women?

Boosting birth rate? Yes the optics on the surface might not be good but news flash, LGBTQ people were never going to contribute anyways. Look further at LGBTQ families and u find them with children, either through surrogacy or adoption or some other non conventional way. Surrogacy is also not recognised in Singapore nor will the govt allow gay couples to adopt, so tell me as a gay man how would i raise children of my own under this status quo?

Rapid rise in housing demand? Where do u think LGBTQ individuals/couples are living right now? some free floating condo in the sky? No, we ofc live in public housing same as 80% of other Singaporeans. Those that can afford it have better homes ofc, same as everyone else. Newsflash No.2: removing 377A alone will not change anything with regards to housing. LGBTQ couples will still not qualify under a couples scheme as there is no legal recognition of their marraige. They will either have to earn enough to buy private property or wait till 35 and apply for small flats under the singles scheme. Even if your ""worst case scenario"" happens and LGBTQ couples can apply for flats same as any other couple, there would only be an initial wave of demand from those currently being held up by the arbitrary age limit of 35, so any gay couple aged >21 to 35 who are in a stable relationship, plan to get married and have the financial ability to buy a flat.

The majority is against it? There is no definite proof of this. As much as there is a vocal minority speak out for my rights, there is also a lesser seen but active minority on the other side actively working against them. I refer u to the AWARE scandal or WAAPD. As for IPS surveys referenced elsewhere, while the methodology is sound, i believe that there is still significant margin for error given that older Singaporeans do not express their beliefs publicly with disregard unlike younger ones. Heck, some of them still believe that the govt will come at them if they decide to have a dissenting opinion on any issue.

At the end of the day, this is slippery slope yes, but i do not see anyone except the vocal minority trying to pave this slope and give us a path to climb. It is only ""best"" managed as it is because it allows the majority to avoid placing an opinion on it, while giving strong opponents something to stand on other than religious arguments, which FYI is moot in this case as Singapore is theoretically secular state.

I disagree. Not sure we would have seen such support for things like the Ashley saga a few years back. You're also seeing far more push back against homophobic platform. See the Joanna Theng issue as a good example. Again, I really doubt you would have seen so many people speaking out against her in years prior.

> In fact your own data shows that <50% of 18-25 feel that homosexual sex is not wrong.

Compared to the 34.3% who do think it is wrong or the 17% who are neutral about the issue, there absolutely is a majority within that age group who doesn't think homosexual sex is wrong.

>Actually yes, that is theoretically the idea behind the democracy.

It isn't though. Democracy doesn't automatically mean the will of majority applies to every issue.

>But saying that public sentiment should be ignored in a democracy runs counter to the point of a democracy.

When it comes to an individual's rights, especially if it's one that involves a person's intrinsic trait (race, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity)? I would say referring to public opinion is a far worse option. What if public sentiment eventually supports Islamophobia or opposes Christianity? Why if the majority are anti-choice?

>However does that mean smoking should be legal everywhere because their ""rights are being restricted""?

I would say referring to public opinion is a far worse option. What if public sentiment eventually supports Islamophobia or opposes Christianity? Why if the majority are anti-choice?

Smoking is legal when it doesn't affect others. Homosexual sex and same sex marriage similarly do not affect others beyond the parties involved. If we're being consistent, then 377A should be repealed and same-sex marriage should be legalized."

Many people were against the casino yes, but you might not be aware of the massive positive impact it may have had on the country. 

To be honest, I don’t have much of an opinion regarding the casinos personally, but in this case, the government may have decided that it’s for the greater good of the country after their deliberation and calculations rather than appeasing those that were against it. 

Again, I don’t claim to be an expert but I imagine these issues are not as simple as lay people like you and me could be able to accurately predict the positive and negative outcomes of. There’s a reason why most of our ministers are scholars and are extremely learned - these are extremely complicated matters. I would imagine selecting the president would be a similar issue - I’m not very informed on this matter unfortunately so I can’t really comment. 

Regarding your example, a huge portion of Singaporeans are Malay. Compared to the population of gay people, I think you can understand why the impact would be much different if that were the case. 

Also, whether we like it or not, currently there is still a somewhat prevalent stigma to gay people. Even though it’s in jest, guys call each other “gay” as a friendly insult without meaning much harm, and a good number of older generation Singaporeans have an actual revulsion to gay people. These factors unfortunately make gay people as somewhat “second class citizens”, and therefore it has taken so long for there to be enough social momentum (due to social media) for gay rights to be brought to the front stage. 

Sorry if this got a little convoluted, but I hope you get my opinion on why your example regarding Malays and the gay population are two scenarios on a massively different scale.

Edit :

Btw, if I’m not mistaken, I think there are certain specific issues which are similar to what you’re bringing up. I think there are certain areas in the SAF that don’t allow Malays to join because of worries of Malaysia. I could be wrong, but I thought that’s an interesting tidbit to ponder over if true. 

Thanks for the civil discussion btw, even if our views may not be the same, I appreciate you not just throwing insults just because I disagreed with you.

They don't care about things being done in private, but fully legitimatising homosexual relationships would ""destabalise society"" in some way. So in their argument, there is indeed ""harm"" being caused to parties beyond those involved.

These are of course subjective opinions, but the government also legislates based on similar sort of subjectivity. For example mandating certain ratio of CMIO within each neighbourhood to prevent racial enclaves is also done in the name of ""preserving stability"" even though there's no concrete evidence that A) racial enclaves will form or that B) society will indeed be unstable especially in the context of SG. Yet where couples choose to purchase flats in is not left up to them, in the name of ""social stability"". This subjectivity also extends to sentencing, for example having the death penalty for drug traffickers is waaaaay overkill, but once again the government determines it to be in the interest of social stability. My point is that there are many examples of governments (not just SG) that suppress the rights of a minority for the sake of the majority, oftentimes with very little pushback from the public. Only certain issues (like homosexual relationships) in modern times attract public outcry and attention. Not saying this is right, but it's just the way things are.

Furthermore, political capital is absolutely a thing. If the government pisses off a whole bunch of people by repealling 377A and within the same year decide they need to implement unpopular policies like raising GST and/or raising CPF retirement age, they'll obviously see a huge dip in popularity compared to if they didn't repeal 377A. They've obviously taken this into consideration that it's not worth it to repeal 377A for the sake of a minority when they have more ""practical"" matters that will affect the entire nation's economy to attend to.

In fact, I could forsee a scenario where if they repeal 377A now and within the next few years implement more unpopular policies, that an opposition party could run on a platform of ""reinstating 377A"" and potentially win some seats in parliament, all from being champions of being anti-gay rights. This would be way worse for homosexual rights if there was a voice in parliament that was proactively anti-gay.

Again, putting the cart before the horse. There are no minority rights being violated by 377A as far as the law is concerned, because there is no right for men to have anal sex with men in Singapore. This is not Europe or America where sexual orientation is explicitly protected by the law. If you want to use a rights-based argument, the relevant right has to be recognised by the law first.

> Change cannot happen from the bottom up in Singapore, because we do not have the right to assemble/protest. It has to be top-down here.

This is a frequent misconception, probably caused by excessive Western influence, that assembling/protest is the *only* way to change rights as defined by the local laws. Clearly untrue, because rights have indeed changed many times in Singapore (e.g. introduction and frequent amendments of the Women's Charter) in the absence of significant assemblies/protests. Rights can be changed, and frequently do change. But the majority of the electorate has to back those changes first. Shanmugam all but directly said in that statement how to repeal 377A.

Minister Shanmugam's statement on retaining 377A,ceddya,"> So in their argument, there is indeed ""harm"" being caused to parties beyond those involved.

But people don't make laws for a reason. Our government does, and you'd expect them to base policy on actual facts. No society has been destabilized because their 377A has been repealed.

It's funny that our government has pushed laws with similar arguments without our fabric being destroyed. See our abortion laws, or how we've de facto legalized prostitution. Or, most recently, look at how we've built casinos. Why is 377A treated differently by pandering to people pushing a bogeyman?

>but the government also legislates based on similar sort of subjectivity.

Refer above. Those are more relevant than the one you gave.

>Furthermore, political capital is absolutely a thing.

Who will they lose it to? PSP have said they won't object a repeal, SDP has said in previous elections that they support a repeal. The WP, PAP's biggest contender, is clearly courting younger voters based on the estate they've chosen to run in. Why would they sacrifice long term political capital for short term game?

>that an opposition party could run on a platform of ""reinstating 377A"" and potentially win some seats in parliament

I don't. No established opposition party is likely to oppose the PAP on a repeal. Not only, Singapore's demographic is already shifting rapidly to be more accepting of LGBT rights, so waiting a few more years isn't going to be conducive to any new party running on reinstating 377A, especially if Singapore remains stable post-repealing 377A. This scenario is highly unlikely.

>There're ramifications for doing it with public sentiment still so strongly opposed to it (for instance simply repealing it doesn't mean public sentiment will suddenly shift.

Refer above.

The fact that your think my own lived experiences in Singapore are imported views shows how balanced you really are.

Already pointed out the flaws and double standards in your points. Funny, you still have yet to give a coherent reply.

>It’s incredibly disappointing that you see this as a cultural war between two “sides” (a word you used) and you hold such an “us vs them” mentality that comes through quite clearly in your post.

Nah, there is no false equivalence here.

The LGBT community has yet to take any hostile actions against conservatives in Singapore. I've given you plenty of examples of religious conservatives attacking the LGBT community (here's another: the Wear White movement). Can you do the converse and give me an example of the LGBT community doing the same?

The LGBT community is fighting for their rights. The religious community is seeking to oppress. The fact that you consider both the same again shows how 'balanced' you really are.

>but hypocrisy on either “side” really irks me.

Where's the hypocrisy? You might want to show it before leveling such accusations.

>Try and make friends from the other side for once, try and see each other’s point of view.

I've served NS but yet don't have the same housing rights. My partner and I won't have the same legal protections afforded to straight married couples. Unlike religious groups, the views of the LGBT community is still heavily censored and we don't have a platform to raise awareness on our issues. As a result, the mental health outcomes of the LGBT community in Singapore is poorer because of the stigma and continued discrimination.

Unlike the other side who isn't actually affected **at all**, I have to live with the actual repercussions of their bigotry. So tell me, what's the other point of view I should see?

It's funny that our government has pushed laws with similar arguments without our fabric being destroyed. See our abortion laws, or how we've de facto legalized prostitution.

Refer above. Those are more relevant than the one you gave.

Who will they lose it to? PSP have said they won't object a repeal, SDP has said in previous elections that they support a repeal. The WP, PAP's biggest contender, is clearly courting younger voters based on the estate they've chosen to run in. Why would they sacrifice long term political capital for short term game?

I don't. No established opposition party is likely to oppose the PAP on a repeal. Not only, Singapore's demographic is already shifting rapidly to be more accepting of LGBT rights, so waiting a few more years isn't going to be conducive to any new party running on reinstating 377A, especially if Singapore remains stable post-repealing 377A.

Straits Times: Transgender issues are real concerns that should not be dismissed,kwkellyng,"When a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms, is it a case of America's culture war over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and queer (LGBTQ) issues being imported into Singapore?

Or could it be that trans youth and their families have genuine issues they are worried about?

Perhaps a mix of both?

Depending on where your sympathies lie, one of the above interpretations will probably resonate with you. 

In January, Ashlee, a teenage transgender girl in junior college, complained in an online post that the Ministry of Education (MOE) had intervened with her treatment, preventing her from obtaining a doctor's referral letter to begin hormone therapy.

The post went viral, attracting much debate over gender identity issues and MOE's policies when dealing with trans students. Days later, a group of five individuals protested against MOE's handling of the case outside its building in Buona Vista. Three were later arrested for allegedly doing so without a permit.

When the issue was raised in Parliament on Feb 1, Education Minister Lawrence Wong said medical decisions on such treatment were made by the student, parents and doctors, and MOE did not have purview over them. He expressed concern that gender identity issues have become ""bitterly contested sources of division in the culture wars in some Western countries and societies"".

He added: ""We should not import these culture wars into Singapore, or allow issues of gender identity to divide our society.""

Cultural imports?

Indeed, in the United States and Britain, fierce debate rages over the inclusion or exclusion of trans people in sports, military service and gender-segregated spaces like bathrooms.

But it is important that when gender identity issues are raised in Singapore, they are considered on their own merit, and not dismissed outright due to concerns over culture wars or importing of foreign ideas.

Mr Wong's cautionary note about culture wars points to LGBTQ issues as an emerging fault line that can lead to social division.

If we are serious about wanting to avoid the kind of polarisation seen in other countries over identity issues, we will need to engage in more discussion, not less. Treating such issues as taboo, for fear of stoking division, may backfire and escalate unhappiness among those who feel like their concerns are not being adequately addressed.

It could also push the discussion towards extreme views, as moderate Singaporeans stay silent and allow the most vocal segments to dominate the conversation.

After all, the LGBTQ, and especially transgender, community has some legitimate concerns, and we can start by acknowledging them, even if we may disagree on how to handle or resolve such concerns.

In any case, it is good to be reminded that gender identity issues are hardly recent imports from the ""West"".

In many ways, Singapore already acknowledges the validity of trans people's experiences and has done so for decades without much fanfare. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Bugis Street was famous (some would say, infamous) for being a hotbed of activity for the local transgender community. By coincidence, the Bugis people of Indonesia were historically known to have a fluid concept of gender, with five distinct gender identities recognised in their culture.

Singapore was also once known for offering sex reassignment surgery. The late Professor S.S. Ratnam, former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at the National University of Singapore, did pioneering work in the field.

The anguish of gender dysphoria

Gender dysphoria is the medical term for the psychological distress experienced by trans people due to the mismatch between their sense of self and their bodies or social roles. This is well recognised as a medical condition. In fact, the Institute of Mental Health, a public healthcare institution, has a gender clinic dedicated to such issues.

Hormone therapy is commonly prescribed in the endocrinology departments of both public and private healthcare institutions here to trans individuals to better align their bodies with their gender identity and alleviate gender dysphoria.

Upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery, trans Singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents, and marry those of the opposite legal sex. The law allowing this was passed in 1973.

It would be fair to say that trans Singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not.

But there are gaps.

One: cost. Less well-off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change. And while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own, younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency, especially if their parents are unsupportive.

Two: support in school.

Unlike in some other countries, MOE does not appear to have a standardised guideline, procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students. ""Recognising that the issues are complex, and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents, we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion,"" Mr Wong told Parliament.

This may be because there is no consensus among Singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear, and MOE may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving.

Schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria, leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students' sense of well-being.

Principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms, hair and bathroom usage according to the student's legal sex. They may take disciplinary action against the student for rule-breaking, if say, a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long.

For those who don't understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms, just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with. If you are a man, imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day. That is more or less what a trans boy would feel: he identifies as male, but is made to wear a girl's uniform.

Gabriel (not his real name) is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in September 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys' uniform. He even sought help from then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung.

By that point, he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment, which masculinised his features and deepened his voice. He told me that during orientation, his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school. But the school insisted he wear the girls' uniform.

He was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys' uniform. Over the next month, as term started in earnest, Gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate. With no sign of a resolution in sight, he soon dropped out. He spent the next year - with his parents' support - undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex. After finally collecting his new NRIC earlier this year, he enrolled again in a different JC.

All of that just to be allowed to wear pants.

Some may ask: What is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like? Why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like Gabriel?

Such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria.

The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is ""associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, school or other important areas of functioning"" and can be worsened by peer ostracism.

Telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the A levels.

Gabriel's experience, and the more recent incident involving Ashlee, both raise legitimate questions about medical issues, such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty, hormone therapy or surgery, as well as social issues, such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children. To avoid a culture war, these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology - but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith.

Rather than being freely given everything they think they want, what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults - parents, teachers, doctors, policymakers and the public.

If trans youth are properly counselled, guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs, they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self-administering hormone medication purchased online, or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of JC, or indeed, to write angry public posts online.

They will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves. That, surely, is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over. - Rei Kurohi",156,1615118347,2021-03-07 11:59:07,"When a transgender teen goes public with her difficulties over medical treatment and the wearing of gendered uniforms, is it a case of America's culture war over lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender and queer (LGBTQ) issues being imported into Singapore?

Upon undergoing sex reassignment surgery, trans Singaporeans can update their legal sex in their official documents, and marry those of the opposite legal sex. The law allowing this was passed in 1973.

It would be fair to say that trans Singaporeans enjoy some rights and privileges that those in many other countries do not.

But there are gaps.

One: cost. Less well-off trans people may not be able to afford the costly surgery that allows them to facilitate a legal administrative change. And while adults can generally make these important decisions on their own, younger trans youth still in school may not have the same agency, especially if their parents are unsupportive.

Two: support in school.

Unlike in some other countries, MOE does not appear to have a standardised guideline, procedure or policy for how schools should deal with the issue of trans students. ""Recognising that the issues are complex, and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents, we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion,"" Mr Wong told Parliament.

This may be because there is no consensus among Singaporeans on what the right approach is when it comes to issues like which uniform these students should be allowed to wear, and MOE may be hesitant to take a clear stand on an issue that is still evolving.

Schools are then left to exercise flexibility when it comes to students with gender dysphoria, leaving school leaders to make decisions that have a major impact on trans students' sense of well-being.

Principals may decide to strictly enforce school rules on uniforms, hair and bathroom usage according to the student's legal sex. They may take disciplinary action against the student for rule-breaking, if say, a student assigned male at birth who identifies as a girl insists on wearing her hair long.

For those who don't understand the big deal about wearing gendered uniforms, just imagine for a moment that you are being forced to don the uniform of the opposite gender to what you identity with. If you are a man, imagine having to wear a blouse and skirt to school every day. That is more or less what a trans boy would feel: he identifies as male, but is made to wear a girl's uniform.

Gabriel (not his real name) is a trans boy who began his medical treatment in September 2019 and spent four months trying to persuade the junior college he had gotten into to allow him to wear the boys' uniform. He even sought help from then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung.

By that point, he had already undergone several months of hormone treatment, which masculinised his features and deepened his voice. He told me that during orientation, his new schoolmates did not know he was trans and related to him as male and he could not bear the thought of turning up in a skirt on the first day of school. But the school insisted he wear the girls' uniform.

He was told he would have to undergo surgery and change his legal sex to male in order to be allowed to wear the boys' uniform. Over the next month, as term started in earnest, Gabriel missed classes while continuing to try to negotiate. With no sign of a resolution in sight, he soon dropped out. He spent the next year - with his parents' support - undergoing the requisite operations to be able to officially change his legal sex. After finally collecting his new NRIC earlier this year, he enrolled again in a different JC.

All of that just to be allowed to wear pants.

Some may ask: What is the big deal with waiting until after you graduate to grow out or cut your hair and dress as you like? Why should the school make exemptions in its rules on uniforms for people like Gabriel?

Such questions reveal a lack of understanding of gender dysphoria.

The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association, recognises gender dysphoria as a mental health condition and notes that it is ""associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, school or other important areas of functioning"" and can be worsened by peer ostracism.

Telling a trans student to delay treatment is like telling a student with depression to avoid seeking treatment until after completing the A levels.

Gabriel's experience, and the more recent incident involving Ashlee, both raise legitimate questions about medical issues, such as what age a person should be before being prescribed treatments like drugs that delay puberty, hormone therapy or surgery, as well as social issues, such as how schools and parents should respond to trans youth and children. To avoid a culture war, these questions should be guided by science rather than ideology - but responses to such cases should also be tempered with empathy and in good faith.

Rather than being freely given everything they think they want, what trans youth need most of all is to have their concerns heard and taken seriously by adults - parents, teachers, doctors, policymakers and the public.

If trans youth are properly counselled, guided and supported by medical experts who are familiar with their needs, they are far less likely to be driven by desperation to seek out alternatives such as self-administering hormone medication purchased online, or to feel that they have no means of continuing their education unless they undergo costly surgery or drop out of JC, or indeed, to write angry public posts online.

They will instead be able to safely continue their schooling while getting help to figure out what the best course of action is for themselves. That, surely, is a goal we should not have to wage a culture war over. - Rei Kurohi"

Trans people have been a large part of Singapore society going as far back as the 1950s - 1980s. See [Bugis Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugis,_Singapore#1950s%E2%80%931980s). 

The first sex change operation in Asia was done in Singapore. It was based on a technique invented by Benjamin Sheares, who also served as our second president, then adapted by S Shan Ratnam for transsexuals. Singapore was renowned in Asia for having the most skilled surgeons with regards to transgender surgeries up until the early 1990s. Transexuals have been legally allowed to change their sex and have been able to legally marry the opposite sex since the 1970s.

If anything, Singapore has imported the conservative, transphobic attitudes of Christian fundamentalists from the west, which led to the government cleansing and eradicating our trans culture.

Supporting transsexuals and their rights would simply be reverting our country's stance on trans people back to what it was before we ""imported"" conservative Christian attitudes from the west.

The largest cultural wars that have been imported were those waged by fundamentalist Christians.

I don't think this is an either/or, because science definitely has a part to play in this too. Science lets us research and analyse the different outcomes for trans youths who go down each path, and from that knowing what is most likely to be beneficial for a particular youth who expresses their gender identity in such and such a way.

There's been some research into determining what factors make it more likely that a gender dysphoric child will persist with a transgender identity into adulthood. Those findings influenced the 2013 DSM-V Gender Dysphoria diagnosis, which has so far been much more accurate than the previous Gender Identity Disorder diagnostic criteria.

But it's still not perfect, and diagnoses are ultimately more of a guideline to help parents and youths figure out what would be best for them.

There also needs to be room for flexibility - e.g. if a trans girl has been insisting she is a girl since she was 2-3 years old, attempted to cut off her genitals, socially transitioned and lived very happily as a girl for years but grew increasingly anguished as puberty approached, it would be quite a clear cut case where puberty blockers should be seriously considered. Vs someone who just always felt something was wrong about their gender but not sure what, were still unsure about whether they were trans or what they wanted to do about it - that would be a situation where it would be more suitable to wait.

I agree about irreversible choices, but that’s the thing - not doing anything is itself an irreversible choice.

Whereas even those who would have otherwise been ok with their bodies would be likely to be just as ok, if not more so, if they had been able to transition young.

It's funny that our government has pushed laws with similar arguments without our fabric being destroyed. See our abortion laws, or how we've de facto legalized prostitution. Or, most recently, look at how we've built casinos. Why is 377A treated differently by pandering to people pushing a bogeyman?

Refer above. Those are more relevant than the one you gave.

Who will they lose it to? PSP have said they won't object a repeal, SDP has said in previous elections that they support a repeal. The WP, PAP's biggest contender, is clearly courting younger voters based on the estate they've chosen to run in. Why would they sacrifice long term political capital for short term game?

I don't. No established opposition party is likely to oppose the PAP on a repeal. Not only, Singapore's demographic is already shifting rapidly to be more accepting of LGBT rights, so waiting a few more years isn't going to be conducive to any new party running on reinstating 377A, especially if Singapore remains stable post-repealing 377A. This scenario is highly unlikely.

I do agree with this, which is why doctors and psychs who specialise in treating trans people should be involved, as well as their parents or guardians.

More importantly, if a child has reached the point of even being considered for medical intervention (it is long and tedious to get there), the odds are highly in favour of them being trans. In that situation, not-intervening would be the major life-changing decision that's much more likely to have lifelong negative effects. The figure is something close to 100% turning out trans if gender dysphoria persists or worsens after puberty. While there's still the slim possibility that they may not grow up to be trans, if there's a 90% likelihood that they will, then the safest, default course of action would actually be transition.

Even among the remaining 10%, for them to reach that point would mean they are very gender non-conforming. Any mistaken medical interventions would thus not have the same impact on them as it would for some random kid. A butch lesbian is less likely to be bothered by having a deeper voice or smaller breasts compared to if it were a super girly girl, for example.

I don't think society understands more than actual doctors, doctors should be able to make this call but in a regulated forum. Doctors are people too, 2 different doctors can have 2 different opinions on the same therapy, that's why we need a regulatory body to decide on those matters. Does that sound fair?

>We already perform far more invasive procedures on children without that can of worm being an option. Should we never operate on children then? What about far more aggressive drugs like chemotherapy? Why then is dysphoria that is causing enough distress to be considered an illness given a different standard for how it should be treated?

#VALIDATING THE PAP.

Except, you know, the PAP.

Chiam Swee Tong won his libel suit against the PAP. The PAP then introduced new laws to make Chiam's work so burdensome that he could not actually represent the people.

Low's WP won Aljunied. Guess what happened next. The AHTC saga.

Again, it's all irrelevant considering outside of the SDP, everyone else is unwilling to play actual hardball with the PAP. And even then the SDP is caving in.

If some guy is un-self-consciously declaring that he’s a beautiful woman and invites people to come look at his vagina, and then the next day is screaming about how Lee Kuan Yew popped up in his room at night and barked at him, that’s probably not a trans person but someone who is delusional.

**No** medical treatment has a 100% success rate. Should we stop all treatments then? Obviously not, that's why consent laws are the focal point. Yet you argue for a different standard when it comes to treating trans children, why?

Fyi, you're still being disingenuous. Puberty blockers do not transition a child/teen, so the issue of transitional regret doesn't even apply here. Beyond that, adults who regret HRT/SRS will have to deal with it just like any other adult undergoing every other procedure.

>MOST BOYS would welcome having sex with anyone at that age

Yeah, so when do their parents consent to them having sex with their teachers? When do those boys sit down with their team of medical professionals to have the risk/benefits fully explained to them so as to obtain a fully informed consent?

**No** medical treatment has a 100% success rate. Should we stop all treatments then? Obviously not, that's why consent laws are the focal point. Yet you argue for a different standard when it comes to treating trans children, why?

Fyi, you're still being disingenuous. Puberty blockers do not transition a child/teen, so the issue of transitional regret doesn't even apply here. Beyond that, adults who regret HRT/SRS will have to deal with it just like any other adult undergoing every other procedure.

Yeah, so when do their parents consent to them having sex with their teachers? When do those boys sit down with their team of medical professionals to have the risk/benefits fully explained to them so as to obtain a fully informed consent?

Yes, it does urge that we continue long term study, but it certainly doesn't recommend banning it. Quite the contrary, it supports current OPS guidelines.

From your OWN article:

>**OPS is likely to promote Phoenix’s well-being** - The concept of well-being considers potential harms, in addition to potential benefits. If the potential benefits of OPS to Phoenix are greater than the potential harms, OPS is likely to promote Phoenix’s well-being. We describe the potential *harms* and *benefits* of OPS for Phoenix (summarised in table 1), and argue that the **latter can reasonably be judged to outweigh the former**.

>We have argued that **it is ethically defensible in principle for clinicians to offer OPS to non-binary adults as a group, as OPS can promote patient well-being and is therefore consistent with the proper goals of medicine.** We also highlighted that, as gender-affirming interventions are routinely offered to binary TGD individuals on well-being-promoting grounds, and there is presumptively no morally relevant difference between binary and non-binary gender identities as such, there is an additional equity-based argument for offering OPS to non-binary adults.

Our class guys initially bullied him cause he always say he has a crush on someone in my group. Whenever we teased him, he would clap back at us by being an unapologetic queen.

Acceptance from others was not something he sought, but he couldn't bring himself to let his parents know. We also don't know how he hid it so well, since he's quite flamboyant.

I think LGBT community in Singapore are out of touch with the reality. Many of the anti-LGBT people are not even religious or subscribed to Abrahamic religion.

Framing abrahamic religion as the sole origin of anti-LGBT stance is a narrative that the western LGBT-group trying to promote. It is a convenient way to explained why there is anti-LGBT sentiment in the west since abrahic religion is their major contributing factor but it is pure intellectual laziness to paint the entire anti-LGBT sentiment the same way. Anti-LGBT sentiment in asian country is not only caused by those who believed in abrahamic religion but also peoples from other religion or non religious


By promoting this narrative, westener lgbt group paints an image that the LGBT were widely accepted across cultures around the world but was then sabotaged by Abrahamic religions. This narrative gives them legitimacy, it provides an illusion of widespread support toward unsuspecting people.

I played aforementioned plotlines as psychological horror - as an exploration of what a world messed up by war, authoritarianism and disregard for the needs of actual human beings can do to a person. That also applies to Sablin, for example; 9/10 times as the AI he gets wiped out by Yagoda and mechanically he is, in order to have a fair chance at winning, incentivised to give up his idealism. Tainted by the world he inhabits, regardless of his dreams.

Some may play horrible leaders as wish fulfillment - and I pray for your soul if you do - but apparently, according to some people, there is nothing wrong with the ""tone"" or ""realism"" of doing so. People who want leaders to not crack down as hard on LGBT people live in a ""unrealistic fantasy land"" but Speer legitimising fascism for the 21st century somehow isn't?

Besides... legal change doesn't necessarily imply rapid social change. Lots of people still have issues with women in the workplace. Legally allowing people to live and love the way they want does not imply that everyone is hugging their trans neighbour, just like Hitler's race laws didn't mean everyone went out Jew hunting before Sunday lunch and just like not every citizen in Eurasia takes up horse archery as a hobby.

In TNO, most people are merely trying to survive. Half your country is still occupied by the Reich, there are wannabe Aryans going around murdering people, people lost friends and family during the struggle for unification. And don't forget - if I were a homophobic leader involved in a mortal struggle that either ends with unification or my execution, I'd sure as hell rather spend state security resources on rooting out the local fascist book club than go after two women sleeping together.

On Realism and the LGBT Issue,real_shaman,"HAHA that’s a good question: I’d say that what the mod does, i.e. portray the decision to legalise/decriminalise LGBT rights as a social choice with moral and practical consequences, already works - it provides agency to the player, allowing them to decide what the “best choice” is, while demonstrating that not all intentions result in good outcomes.

You raised the point that leaders in TNORussia’s environment do not have the social or political capital to make radical social changes - well, it’s difficult to say what is or isn’t possible in the chaos, but I personally believe that to better reflect that we would probably need a whole-ass “social capital” mechanic to demonstrate what populations would be comfortable with accepting. 

Of course there is no way to conceivably model the diverse and situational “Overton Window” of a country within the game’s boundaries... but perhaps that could be the first step towards simulating a society that fits both my understanding of how societies can change and your understanding of the constraints of said change.

As for why I go? It's easy to use your words as an excuse and tell people I know: ""See? Trans folks think I am a transphobic so I shouldn't attend"" and then I can sit my ass at home during Pink Dot. I am sure my sister would be pleased

But even I can see that's just the lazy and easy way out. So as I've told you repeatedly - I will still go. Not for your sake but for hers because she asked me year after year to go

As for giving a shit? There's different magnitudes of it. I give some amounts of shit for her struggles

She is pitiful, no doubt about it. I do hope she finds her happiness (and money and bf who would accept her) eventually

As for it being an ego boost? That's a tough one for me to decide. I don't know enough about myself to know if this is an ego boost or not

As for bad problems. Well, I have my fair share. Sometimes it's not so bad if she and I could swap bodies for a day or two so I can understand her struggles better and she understands mine (if it isn't clear enough yet from how I've been replying to you, I am not exactly a normal man.

Christian group ‘deeply concerned’ about Singapore psychologists supporting LGBT,Boogie_p0p,"> SPS, which comprises more than 500 registered psychologists, said last week that they support the use of evidence-based practices when treating the mental health of LGBT individuals as well as affirming their sexual orientations and gender identities.

>“However, as a psychological association, SPS seems to be unfairly painting all forms of religious help for people struggling with same-sex attraction or gender identity issues to be ‘practicing conversion therapy’. This could not be further from the truth,” Truelove.is said. It described the research and data shared by SPS as **“unqualified.”**

 >There are a number of passages in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament that have been interpreted as involving same-sex sexual acts and desires. These interpretations form the basis of Jewish and Christian attitudes towards homosexuality. The passages about homosexuality in the Hebrew Bible start as early as the Torah (the first five books of the Bible). Several scriptures in the New Testament also reference homosexuality, including the Gospel in the books of Matthew, Luke, and various letters from Saint Paul to the early churches in Asia Minor.

1988 Operation Spectrum: The government accused the 22 detainees involved of working on behalf of FUESSMO, “Filipino leftists”, the Church, Tan Wah Piow and the US government to install a Marxist state, before making amendments to laws regarding the judiciary and organising a huge protest.

When the incumbent has enough social sway to 

#FORCE EVEN THE SOCDEM SDP TO PLAY BY THE CALVINBALL RULES THAT IS SINGAPORE'S POLITICAL PROCESS,

voting anything else is basically

#VALIDATING THE PAP.

Chiam Swee Tong won his libel suit against the PAP. The PAP then introduced new laws to make Chiam's work so burdensome that he could not actually represent the people.

Low's WP won Aljunied. Guess what happened next. The AHTC saga.

Again, it's all irrelevant considering outside of the SDP, everyone else is unwilling to play actual hardball with the PAP. And even then the SDP is caving in.

Hi, i consulted a law student friend of mine about this. So yes, while it’s true there are no laws regarding recording conversations itself. However, she told me that making the recording public is the contentious part as the recording party can POSSIBLY be sued for defamation (even if permission is asked beforehand, the recording itself is not the problem, its the publicizing of the information). It can still be okay if the person can prove they have reason to publicize it.

She has suggested that if OP were to record the conversation (with or without permission), to read up on POFMA, POHA and PDPA. She also sent me the following links:

You shouldn't conflate businesses with the LGBTQ movement.

Pride isn't about companies who want to make money of us.

Pride is the one day where queer people celebrate and unashamedly express who they are, in a space where we're all accepted... no matter how one wants to express themselves. It's about acceptance.

Not as and how you or anyone else decides we should be. (and that includes how we dress)

Inclusive to this, pride is also about recognizing that we are no where equal. We're still marginalized by society and a lot of harm is still done to us.

If you inherently believe that people should be treated equally regardless of sexuality or gender identity, gender expression, sex characteristics, then seeing a few people who are half naked or naked at pride shouldn't change that.

if that's all it takes, I don't know if you supported the LGBTQ movement in the first place."

"To all fellow LGBT+ Singaporeans, HAPPY PRIDE MONTH!!!!",whateverathrowaway00,"Yeah, I’m conflicted on it - as I also remember my admittedly cringey freshly out 19 year old days and do acknowledge that a major driver in legitimization and reform has been the less family friendly members of our community and wildly believe that they are valuable founders and parts of everhthing.

At the same time, as I get older, I do wonder where the line is and how we draw it? Because pride isn’t marketed as a circuit party or a kink festival.

The issue is that some people see any semblance of controlling extremes as “selling out,” “normalization,” or trying to dispose of people who are and always will be a major part of what spurred our modern movement forward.

So, it’s challenging. Like I said, I live somewhere in the middle. I’m perfectly alright with the leather daddies and their gear and a party vibe, but for example I think it’s reasonable to restrict full on nudity and draw some lines.

A common theme that i like in some places is a more restrained vibe in the day and then less restrictions as night falls and progresses - which seems perfectly reasonable to me.

Luckily, I’m not the arbiter of pride and don’t want that thankless task aha. There are also political issues these days thanks to intersectionalism - many pride organizers try to make political statements with who they allow/disallow at events - some of which I like, some of which I don’t, but they seem to miss the boat in my opinion, especially with the corporatization of it meaning pride is basically a giant investment party now.

Joint Statement by Asian NGOs to condemn arrest of peaceful protestors against LGBT discrimination in Singapore - The Online Citizen Asia,Pyrrylanion,"There’s still some legal recourse left. Don’t exaggerate.

While appeal by social media had failed, no one is stopping them from going to the MPS and appeal to the people they/their parents helped elect as their *representatives*.

Unless the MP chased them out and refuse to write a letter, and MOE continue pretending that they never see anything, its hardly so desperate that you need to protest.

Come on, haven’t even file a constitutional challenge on this yet leh. Hardly call it “no recourse left”. Can file so many for 377A, cannot file for this?

Protesting in Singapore isn’t actually any good for recourse. Protesting is like taking the appeal by social media up one level, but its effectiveness is down by one level. If they can completely ignore the appeal by social media, chances are, protesting will only get you into trouble with very little realistic chance of change.

However, if the social media appeal caught on with wide appeal and the govt is desperately trying to ignore, maybe forcing their hand with physical protest might turn the table. But this is not the case here. Within certain circles yes, this might be an issue people care about. But outside of that smallish circle, people don’t care. It failed to have strong widespread appeal, and that’s what dooming the whole cause right now.

Protest and arrest and the general public also don’t care. If general public doesn’t care, you can *forget* about PAP caring.

Joint Statement by Asian NGOs to condemn arrest of peaceful protestors against LGBT discrimination in Singapore - The Online Citizen Asia,Pyrrylanion,"And protesting helps? They will simply throw you into jail and that somehow *being jailed* help with dysphoria or discrimination?

If that protest comes with a prison stint, is that not waiting? Oh and *enjoy* going to the wrong gender prison unless you had SRS (given that they are mostly kids, probably not).

Are we talking about transgender people or people who identifies as prisoners?

We are not in the US. Protesting is simply not feasible. It gives PAP a legal basis to screw you over. If you want to *get screwed even more*, go ahead. Protesting only works if you had so much widespread popular support that it is *politically unfeasible* to screw you or ignore your grievances.

Edit: extra:

And even if the protest gave *international exposure*, so what? Singapore is a close partner/ally of the US/Western countries not because we are similar in ideology. We are close because we are geopolitically interesting to them. The PAP can get away jailing these kids or other not so egregious actions, and *no other country will bat an eyelid*. At most issue strongly worded letters that does nothing!

How about all that NGO responses? *Hello*? Have you been living in Singapore? If anyone does, they should know that the government has a very long history in ignoring unfavourable NGO reports and suing foreign media. Some random NGO issuing their “grave concern” isn’t going to do anything.

What makes the PAP do anything is simple. *Votes*. If these kids had popular support, then PAP will be so scared that they would at least try to make an exemption for Ashlee to quieten things down (and maybe for these kids too).

Outside of some circles, I don’t think I had heard the general public giving many fucks about the news of these kids protesting.

So, if there is no widespread popular support already, what do you expect protesting to do? Right now its the same circle of progressives who are concerned about this, the same group that PAP has *ignored* for so damn bloody long. They already ignored all the uproar over 377A, you think they cannot ignore for this?

These kids are paying a price that’s potentially high over *nothing significant*. That’s not smart at all.",-7,1611965427,2021-01-30 00:10:27,"And protesting helps? They will simply throw you into jail and that somehow *being jailed* help with dysphoria or discrimination?

If that protest comes with a prison stint, is that not waiting? Oh and *enjoy* going to the wrong gender prison unless you had SRS (given that they are mostly kids, probably not).

Are we talking about transgender people or people who identifies as prisoners?

We are not in the US. Protesting is simply not feasible. It gives PAP a legal basis to screw you over. If you want to *get screwed even more*, go ahead. Protesting only works if you had so much widespread popular support that it is *politically unfeasible* to screw you or ignore your grievances.

Edit: extra:

And even if the protest gave *international exposure*, so what? Singapore is a close partner/ally of the US/Western countries not because we are similar in ideology. We are close because we are geopolitically interesting to them. The PAP can get away jailing these kids or other not so egregious actions, and *no other country will bat an eyelid*. At most issue strongly worded letters that does nothing!

How about all that NGO responses? *Hello*? Have you been living in Singapore? If anyone does, they should know that the government has a very long history in ignoring unfavourable NGO reports and suing foreign media. Some random NGO issuing their “grave concern” isn’t going to do anything.

What makes the PAP do anything is simple. *Votes*. If these kids had popular support, then PAP will be so scared that they would at least try to make an exemption for Ashlee to quieten things down (and maybe for these kids too).

Outside of some circles, I don’t think I had heard the general public giving many fucks about the news of these kids protesting.

So, if there is no widespread popular support already, what do you expect protesting to do? Right now its the same circle of progressives who are concerned about this, the same group that PAP has *ignored* for so damn bloody long. They already ignored all the uproar over 377A, you think they cannot ignore for this?

Do we just sit there and continue being trampled just so that the ""silent majority"" does not have to worry about feeling slight discomfort? Should we wait till our LGBT youths commit suicide before deciding it's a problem that needs to be tackled?"

If you're on the side of it's irresponsible to protest the harm being done to trans and queer people in school and we should wait for a legal solution while they're dying and being harmed, **you can quite rightly fuck right off** and check how comfortable your life is.

Protesting does not happen if there are actual avenues. [It is the language of the unheard](https://news.yahoo.com/riot-language-unheard-martin-luther-101603477.html). If ministers had actually met with anyone, and they had so many opportunities in the last 10-20 years to do so, no one would be protesting right now.

You just don't get it do you? It's not a straight line fairy tale where the government and ministers does what they're supposed to. They don't when it comes to queer people and their issues.

We can't even get a seat at the table.

So fuck right off and learn a thing or two about our situation in your country whom you think so idealistically about.

Joshua Wong embodies the sentiment of Hong Kongers, and given the record turnout to protests and all, that is the difference. He’s the face of freedom loving Hong Kongers.

International exposure is also strong, given that Hong Kong is the former star colony of the East, and the CCP recent antagonistic moves had made them enemies of many. All the more people care about CCP atrocities like Hong Kong crackdown or the plight of Ugyhurs.

Even if Joshua is executed by the CCP, he would have managed to drag the CCP along, and bringing them down together.

Remember, international interest is not a thing about morality. Its about whether it can grab the international headlines and the attention of world leaders. When the Hutus killed the Tutsis by the thousands in Rwanda, there wasn’t much condemnation or concern.

To compare these kids to HK democracy is hardly a fair comparison. The conditions are so far apart.

There is no *widespread* support here and there is hardly any serious international interest. Singapore news to other countries are just something people would promptly forget after reading, unless we cane some Americans or something.

These kids aren’t even perceived as face of anything, *not even the face for transgender rights*. To many ordinary Singaporeans, they are just kids with too much time and too much opinions. This is the hard truth.",5,1611984447,2021-01-30 05:27:27,"Joshua Wong is different.

The point here is whether there is any legal recourse, to which my argument is that there is, and it is not yet exhausted.

Back to the democracy point, the opposition politicians are working towards democracy through legal avenues, while Jolovan is far more controversial.

In the end, it is those who played within the legal framework that chips away PAP’s one party dominance a GRC at a time. Jolovan can make a lot of noise but he is insignificant to PAP’s hold on power.

And from the actions of all opposition politicians, we now know that it is the *broad based appeal* that ultimately changes the political landscape of Singapore. People are far more likely in general to throw their support behind people like Pritam Singh or Tan Cheng Bock, as compared to Jolovan. 

This is something a lot of SJW doesn’t know or care and often overlook. A movement would fare much better having broad support and appeal, instead of being controversial and divisive (potentially by adoption of the either you are with us or you are my enemy mentality). 

*Your goal is to appeal to enough people in the society to make change happen*, not anything else, and certainly not making yourself feel better (which is selfish). Change almost always must involve society, this is a fact.

What am I but another redditor right? People want to shoot themselves on the foot why would I bother putting arguments to convince them otherwise? I’m arguing on approach and yet people already don’t like discussions and alternative views on *approach*.

Creating controversies may bring you headlines and a lot of attention, and making things black-and-white may give you a lot of the feeling of moral “superiority”, but can that translate to results? That I would beg to differ.

Go ahead and downvote and double down on circlejerking. The more you alienate others, the more distant you will get from your goal, and the higher the risk of reactionary forces.

The youth rights movement (also known as youth liberation) seeks to grant the rights to young people that are traditionally reserved for adults, due to having reached a specific age or sufficient maturity. This is closely akin to the notion of evolving capacities within the children's rights movement, but the youth rights movement differs from the children's rights movement in that the latter places emphasis on the welfare and protection of children through the actions and decisions of adults, while the youth rights movement seeks to grant youth the liberty to make their own decisions autonomously in the ways adults are permitted to, or to lower the legal minimum ages at which such rights are acquired, such as the age of majority and the voting age. Youth rights have increased over the last century in many countries. The youth rights movement seeks to further increase youth rights, with some advocating intergenerational equity.

Joint Statement by Asian NGOs to condemn arrest of peaceful protestors against LGBT discrimination in Singapore - The Online Citizen Asia,sgtransitevolution,"What do you mean by forced? I would say in our case the peace in our society is not forced, but instead just a result of the self-fulfilling prophecy based on our society’s opinion that the society itself is peaceful.

For example, in the many previous decades, our society has believed that we have achieved the maximum level of racial harmony that can be attained. Hence, we have a racially harmonious society. You can say that well there’s problems here and there that have never been resolved, but since the oppressed didn’t know that they are oppressed, harmony is kept within society. Is that dystopia? Not really for those minorities, since the concept isn’t really there. It only seems dystopian to us since now we know what racism is suppose to be. This idea is only questioned in recent years, in the form of privileges and stuff. Not that it’s a bad thing, but when people stop believing that this society entails complete racial harmony, the self-fulfilling prophecy ends and cracks begin to form as people fight to achieve a higher level of racial harmony... but at what cost?

This Singaporean brand of stable peace can only be stable by an adherence to the status quo, which currently consists of a lack of awareness to social issues. Unfortunately, the very act of doing something about a problem that is conflicting with the opinion of society – while a noble cause – will destabilise society as well. Hopefully, change isn’t done in a manner that is too radical on the progressive side, and the pushback isn’t too severe from the conservative side. Otherwise, Singapore will descend into the American or Hong Kong kind of chaos if change is forced too rapidly, or stagnate into irrelevance if nothing is done at all.

Unfortunately, the very act of doing something about a problem that is conflicting with the opinion of society – while a noble cause – will destabilise society as well. Hopefully, change isn’t done in a manner that is too radical on the progressive side, and the pushback isn’t too severe from the conservative side. Otherwise, Singapore will descend into the American or Hong Kong kind of chaos if change is forced too rapidly, or stagnate into irrelevance if nothing is done at all.

Still, I do think something needs to be done for the better when it comes to LGBT rights in Singapore. Continue advocating for it, just try to align to the interests of the majority to stay relevant and continue garnering more support."

You're confused about definitions. Meritocracy doesn't mean equality, or that everyone starts on the same starting line. That's a strawman argument. 

Meritocracy just means that jobs and other resources get distributed on the basis of ability (as opposed to other things like race or noble birth or religion). And that is what happens in Singapore, generally. Ability itself is never distributed equally, because genetics/wealth/parental investment/personal experiences/etc. aren't distributed equally either. Meritocracy is not perfect fairness, it's simply the least unfair option available to allocate jobs and resources.

Nah, this is one of the things I can't stand about modern feminism, and why I consider myself anti-feminist.

You can't claim to be weaker than me, and then demand that I change my entire mental framework to conform to yours before I can even start engaging. That's a self-contradictory stance.

Nah. ""Educate yourself"" is another stance I can't stand. Self-Googling just leads down rabbit holes of poor sources and misinformation, because the Internet is so big that you can find support for any position you Google for. 

If I asked you to do research to support QAnon or flat earth, you'd find plenty of sources supporting that to. In the end, you'll just intensify your belief in whatever position you started with.

Anyway, as I already alluded, I'm non-Chinese, and I'm already putting effort in helping ethnic minorities in Singapore. My way, not yours. Yours simply demoralises and disempowers ethnic minorities, and leads to self-fulfilling prophecies of disenfranchisement. If you tell a kid that society is stacked against him and out to get him, then don't be surprised if that kid gives up on society and self-exiles to the margins.

You're confused about definitions. Meritocracy doesn't mean equality, or that everyone starts on the same starting line. That's a strawman argument. 

Meritocracy just means that jobs and other resources get distributed on the basis of ability (as opposed to other things like race or noble birth or religion). And that is what happens in Singapore, generally. Ability itself is never distributed equally, because genetics/wealth/parental investment/personal experiences/etc. aren't distributed equally either. Meritocracy is not perfect fairness, it's simply the least unfair option available to allocate jobs and resources.

Nah, this is one of the things I can't stand about modern feminism, and why I consider myself anti-feminist.

You can't claim to be weaker than me, and then demand that I change my entire mental framework to conform to yours before I can even start engaging. That's a self-contradictory stance.

Joint Statement by Asian NGOs to condemn arrest of peaceful protestors against LGBT discrimination in Singapore - The Online Citizen Asia,Pyrrylanion,"It is a good politician’s job to be calculative.

A few LGBT kids who can’t vote for them in the first place, with support from people who tend not to vote PAP anyway, why would they care? 

The voters can be generally classed into three groups over this issue: pro-LGBT, neutral/no opinion, and reactionaries. Pro-LGBT groups aren’t going to be satisfied with small changes to loyally vote PAP. No opinion people mostly think these kids have nothing better to do and couldn’t really care that PAP changes nothing. Reactionaries who loyally votes PAP might not be happy if PAP concedes to these kids.

Reactionaries already made it quite clear they don’t want to see any concessions, and there is no guarantee how far the concessions need to go to secure pro-LGBT voters. Some might think certain LGBT people wouldn’t want anything other than *total victory*, which is almost impossible for the government to deliver.

This is not even including the mildly against LGBT people sitting in the neutral group. That is more unpredictability and more risks.

Furthermore, why would they risk alienating their reactionary support base when they are already facing increased loss of votes from other bread and butter issues?

So, why would they want to change anything, just because a few kids held some placards?

These kids are quite some way away from convincing the general public to care about this issue, and have almost no chance convincing the reactionary types. The PAP doesn’t need to fear them at all.

A protest by 1 *insignificant* person is a nuisance. A protest by a handful of insignificant people is simply just a little more than nuisance. If it’s not some sizeable coordinated protest with large amount of sympathy from the neutral group, I would hardly think the government would be shitting their pants.

They didn’t shit their pants with record breaking Pink Dot turnout, why the hell would they be scared of a few kids, enough for them to change policy?

Joint Statement by Asian NGOs to condemn arrest of peaceful protestors against LGBT discrimination in Singapore - The Online Citizen Asia,drmchsr0,"Keep in mind that first and foremost, I'm not LGBT and a lot of my reasons are political in nature.

The major one is that you can't freely criticize the PAP or the (at least in theory) government. There's a ton of examples of that, starting from JBJ and ending with the PM's own family. I have no delusions about what can and will happen if I accidentally open my mouth, or even so much as write about how I feel.

Secondly, the ISA exists. Yes, I will acknowledge that the ISA is a lot harder to use today than it was 20 years ago and that in theory, there's so much red tape and oversight needed that the one being charged has to be very much definitely a terrorist and the evidence existing. Still, the fact it exists, plus Operation Spectrum, leads me to believe that that there is a non-zero chance of it being activated when the time is right.

Thirdly, the way the PAP treats political opponents scares me. Add to that how they've effectively forced the opposition to basically play by their rules or die isn't very encouraging either.

No matter how careful I am, I will always make a mistake. That mistake can be capitalized by just about anyone to turn me into a social pariah or worse.
