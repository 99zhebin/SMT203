A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,FutureSecret5503,"You obviously has a lack of understanding of CECA vs the other FTAs. 

Only the CECA has the clause on mutual recognition of standards in 4-5 major sectors of the economy to facilitate entry of Indian nationals in these sectors into S’pore.

In addition, only the CECA and 2 other FTAs have the cause on freedom of movement of persons in 127 professions. The only diff is that nationals of the other 2 FTA countries have not flooded our island unlike India which has seen a 500% increase in EP holders since 2010.

And finally, the CECA’s clause on ICTs is very generous compared with other FTAs. While other FTAs have maximum length of 5 years for their nationals to stay here, the CECA allows Indians to stay here for up to 8 years.

How else do you explain the flood of Indian nationals into our island to the extent that at one point, our cinemas were showing so many Hindi movies - even more than Chinese and no Malay movies?

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,TakingPrivateALevels,">more Indian-Singaporeans were on the receiving end of these racist attacks rather than Indian expats

This is the real problem. Back when hostility against China Chinese was widespread in Singapore, this did not lead to an increase in racism against Chinese Singaporeans. The two groups were easy to tell apart (different appearance and accents) and ethnic Chinese are the majority in Singapore. We usually referred to China Chinese as ""PRCs"", never ""Chinese"".

Contrast how Singaporeans refer to India Indians as simply ""Indians"" which could also refer to Indian Singaporeans. The two groups are not as easy to distinguish by appearance and accent; in fact, some Chinese Singaporeans have the misconception that Tamil = Singaporean and North Indian = foreigner.

My company once worked with an IT vendor whose team was mainly India Indians. Dealing with them was very frustrating and they completely failed to deliver on their promises (eventually we had to cancel the project). During and after the project, I noticed an increase in (not ethnic Indian) colleagues making racist remarks, not only against the vendor, but also against Indian Singaporean colleagues.",Negative,1,1631763600,2021-09-16 03:40:00,"

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,Boring_Landscape,"""The second reason for the higher concentration of Indians in higher-paying jobs is because of the growth of the IT and tech sector across the world, hence, the need for more IT professionals. Indians generally make up the bulk of the IT jobs not because our education is superior but simply because the system produces so many people with the required skill set. The fact that there are so many trained professionals in India who can speak English and also work for a relatively lower salary is the primary reason for recruitment for India. Again this is not because the Indian education system is better than Singapore or any other country's education system, it's simply that we have more people to meet the demand and as a result of an abundant supply of professionals, there is higher competition for these jobs. You see more Indians because of our larger population and abundance of trained professionals. If you're wondering why there aren't as many Chinese as Indians it's simply because we have an English advantage, a remnant of being the jewel in the crown of the British Empire for 200 years.""  


Type so much just to validate that Indians have more 'Professionals' for IT job?. and 2ndly comparing about chinese and indians because Indians english is better because they have been colonized.

Singapore education is better and we provide English lesson more competitve than in India. Your country being colonized doesn't mean your english is better than us. It's subjective to each person whether they are willing to learn it or not. and tbh English is not the primary reason needed to work in IT.  Don't have to brag about english, IT is very systematic and more to problem-solving.   


"" Indians generally make up the bulk of the IT jobs not because our education is superior but simply because the system produces so many people with the required skill set. ""  


Don't kid yourself. Indians can get fake certification till they make it into the job. What kind of bullshit professionalism are you bragging about?. Singapore hire lecturers for thousand of dollars who are really expert in their field and provide from basic to advance knowledge with business samples, but yes I can admit our education system may be slow at times as IT fastly evolved..

There are other locals who are suitable to replace your role, yet they couldn't get it because of the underhanded system implemented.

Please don't start the 'loCaLs cAn Do WhAt' argument. Those qualified to do the jobs of the Indians that came in because of CECA are employed successfully (mostly tech & middle management). It's a simple supply/demand thing.   


I do agree the influx of Indians has been higher than 'normal'. But let's not forget there was a similar drastic influx in the early 2000s and well, we are supposed to be a more advanced, mature society now. Yet, I see so many Singaporeans taking the chance to spout racist shit.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,lonesomedota,"I guess this is the trend now. Right wing nationalist and populist politics that will win opposition votes and force ICA and MOM will tighten the door on every FTs.

Ultimately everybody knows it will be bad for Singapore. Economically wise , FDI will reduce, MNCs will shift their HQs elsewhere, even Singapore companies would outsource white collar jobs to other countries, accelerated further by technology and covid. Politically SG parliament will be in gridlock where politicians primarily worry about winning election than running the country, prompt each parties to pursue even more populist stance.

They’ll never admit to their xenophobia or racism tho.
They’ll always be hiding behind the usual “we want the best for Sgporeans”.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,Thaithrowaway1985,"This post is good, but the main points in it, in my personal opinion, has been repeated over and over again in mainstream media, and there are no good solutions to the 2 main issues:

1) retrenched local Singaporean professionals stuck in low-paying odd jobs with no future prospects. The government has no good solution to this and the retrenched local professionals are not likely to keep quiet and accept their fate. Problem is, in my petsonal opinion, it seems many people, including the government and many expats, seem to want these locals to keep quiet and accept their fate

2) in my personal opinion, one thing unnoticed and ignored is r/sg is that actually, the government knows very well that Singapore (note that I say Singapore, not Singaporeans) indeed do need foreigners to survive. This is something I agree with, that Singapore need foreigners to survive. But what is ignored is that while the authorities are very comfortable with increased foreign presence in Singapore's economy, it is not comfortable when vast segments of any industry/sector are dependent on foreign expats from just a few countries. What it wants is a heavily diversified international workforce. The companies and employers that have trouble having their work passes approved are the one that keep recruiting from the same nationality pool. On the other hand, companies that actively make efforts to recruit widely from several different countries rather than a few countries have an easier time. The recent outcry from companies whom complain about increasing work pass restrictions are the ones that still cannot diversify beyond the same recruitment pool

In addition, despite the recent complains over the last 11 years, in absolute numbers, the number of E-Pass and S-Pass and PR granted has increased, even though the ""rate of increase"" has dropped. It is not that less foreigners are granted E-Pass, S-Pass or PR but the raw number of applicants have increased, due to the recent political situation in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and foreign talented migrants are fleeing from those areas, coming into Singapore, usually more skilled and more investment dollars, and there are only so many slots open for foreign talent.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,vanguy79,"Like many Singaporeans, we are sorry that we made you and other Indians feel discriminated against. Yes the points you made are very valid and thanks for pointing out the hypocrisy. 

This is what my observation is. Is there a racial undertone for this target against CECA? Yes there is. Many Singaporeans are racists. Unlike Other countries we don’t say it out loud usually or we don’t refuse service. But there are racists. 

But it so happens so many factors combine to make this a target. First, our dear government steamrolls the citizens opinions by ignoring our feedback and make policies regardless. 

Second, this pandemic causes many working Singaporeans to lose their jobs or lose their opportunity for advancement which causes many Singaporeans to feel aggrieved. 

Thirdly, it sure doesn’t help that there are many anecdotal evidence companies are hiring more of a certain nationality than locals. Too many to ignore the stories. This is true of western owned companies too by the way. There was a recent report last year of a British Aerospace engineering firm that made the news of a hiring imbalance. 

Let’s put it this way. Until recently as I understand, India is very strict about foreign direct investment that restrict foreign companies to own their Indian office unless there is a joint venture with local companies. This ensures local Indian companies has a say and direct influence over manpower. 
Singapore has no such restriction as far as I understand. Apart from local manpower laws that requires a certain percentage of local hires but it does not care if local hires are only hired to do admin work or menial work. As such locals does not have any way to influence hiring decisions in MNCs or foreign companies that set up businesses here compared to India. Hence why Singaporeans are not happy with our government regulations and trade pacts signed being too lax with regards to foreign manpower.",Neutral,1,1631762830,2021-09-16 03:27:10,"Like many Singaporeans, we are sorry that we made you and other Indians feel discriminated against.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,hikari8807,"On the point as to why is CECA singled out amongst the 26 FTAs.

It wasn't Singaporeans who first had the idea that CECA made Singapore obligated free movement of indians to Singapore. It is the indian government who planted the idea by threatening to take Singapore Government to court for not upholding their [Obligation] to CEC Agreement.

Source: https://m.timesofindia.com/business/international-business/singapore-blocks-visas-for-indian-it-professionals/articleshow/57981840.cms

On the second point, which you claimed that Singaporeans had issue because it is indian, and no one would complaint it had been Chinese or Caucasian majority. First of all, this statement is racist as hell. Back in early 2000s, when Singapore experienced an influx of PRCs, Singaporeans complaint about it too. You can find that reference in the same parliamentary session you refer to. This has nothing to do with race. It is about protecting the welfare, rights and benefit of locals.

Many foreigners came to Singapore with little regards to the local culture, way of life and respect for the people here. Some expat seems to have a sense of moral and status superiority over the locals. 

https://mothership.sg/2019/10/deepavali-angry-condominium-security-guard/

I hope I don't come across being racist, but despite the caste system was abolish in India decades ago, many indians continue to emit differential treatment to people based on their skin colour. My Singaporean indian friend share with me he had very negative experience with indians coming from india, especially those from a much northern parts of india.

The presentation of the sentiment today is not a simple cause of racism or a deliberate manipulation of a single politicians to go against an entire group of people. It is a systemic issue that has compounded over the years. It would be wrong to point fingers at Singaporeans put labels to their expression. Indian government and media itself contributed to the misinformation and fueling of emotions.

But I think if you stay in Singapore for a few more years, you will notice that this goes through a cycle. At one point, it was the Pinoys, then another time, it was the PRCs being targetted. Then Caucasians were also targetted with their lavish expat packages.

So I think the backlash isn’t really targetted at Indians, but to foreigners in general. And I think it’s common, not that it’s right.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,chaiporneng,"I applaud you for sharing your thoughts.  There was also the Ramesh event that added fuel to the simmering unease about foreigners.  Years ago, some caucasians also acted with similar disrespect towards locals (making fun of trishaw uncles).

I personally really like the variety of Indian food that the new NRI immigrants have brought to Singapore.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,FamiliarSource98,"I'm an Indian PR, been living here since young (probably 3 or 4)  as far as I can tell, attended local schools (from pri all the way up to poly), although I had little or no friends during lower primary, that slowly changed when I reached pri 4/5 I made friends with other races including Malays and Chinese too and I don't treat them any different nor do they. Had the best experiences/fun and am very happy my closest friends today are local Chinese and Malays, as a matter of fact, I'm serving my National Service at the moment and am very happy and proud to do so alongside my Singaporean counterparts and overall I absolutely love this country very much and it's the closest country to being a ""perfect"" country, politics aside. 

After reading through some of the replies here, I can see why the comments about how some individuals can be obnoxious, I agree too. I feel as an Indian, it is taught to us to be competitive since young and the mindset has always been there to compare ourselves with each other. I think it's a whole cultural thing that has propagated into some people having massive egos and looking down on others once they're successful, this behaviour is something that I do not condone and find absolutely disgusting, though that is changing.

That being said, I do hope people realise these loud obnoxious pricks do NOT represent us, and I myself am pretty disgusted by such people. At the end of the day, I guess you should be grounded and grateful especially if you're given an opportunity to work in a first world country and efforts should be made to assimilate and integrate and  into the local community.

While all we hear are about the loud and bad apples, there are many people who aren't like that and not everyone is as such. I won't talk much about the ceca thing but I would also say on the other hand it's quite hurting to read some pretty harsh remarks/stereotypes and generalisations made at the race/country in general just because of a few bunch of idiots.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,ShadeX8,"First of all, you are very welcomed here in Singapore, and please don't put some of the comments you might have seen to mind. Always remember that online discourse is always going to be a minority portion of the population.

There is a point you've made that kind of resonated with me, in explaining why Indians are the punching bag in the conversation right now. The point being that low end jobs had historically been dominated by Indian workers, and that might have seeped into our social conscience. With the increasing visibility of highly paid Indian workers, it does make me wonder if some class discrimination is at play with the hostility. It's not going to be a conscious thing, but rather, a subconscious idea that Indian workers were supposed to be low-paid, and that a change in that status discomforts some of these loud dissenters. 

My personal thought on this is that there is some hangover displeasure from the White Paper era, where immigration was considered pretty lax and EP/S-passes were quite readily available too. Even though from then on, there were quite visible steps towards tightening that flow, some of the locals still have that impression of easy access and unlimited influx of foreign labor. 

Globalization is also definitely a part of the problem, and in fact, a lot of this discourse is being replicated in many developed countries in their own forms and conflicts. Think a lot of the 'racism' is actually just a fear of the unknown, and fear of being displaced in their place of birth/comfort. 

Haven't seen any developed country solve this societal issue yet, so it's still up in the air as to whether Singapore will ever pull through this. Hopefully we can find a middle ground somewhere, and it does bear to mind that everyone is just looking to survive and earn a living. Don't hate on the people, even if you have issues with the immigration policies.",Positive,1,1631712747,2021-09-15 13:32:27,"First of all, you are very welcomed here in Singapore, and please don't put some of the comments you might have seen to mind.

Don't hate on the people, even if you have issues with the immigration policies.",first of all you are very welcomed here in singapore and please do not put some of the comments you might have seen to mind always remember that online discourse is always going to be a minority portion of the population  there is a point you have made that kind of resonated with me in explaining why indians are the punching bag in the conversation right now the point being that low end jobs had historically been dominated by indian workers and that might have seeped into our social conscience with the increasing visibility of highly paid indian workers it does make me wonder if some class discrimination is at play with the hostility it is not going to be a conscious thing but rather a subconscious idea that indian workers were supposed to be lowpaid and that a change in that status discomforts some of these loud dissenters   my personal thought on this is that there is some hangover displeasure from the white paper era where immigration was considered pretty lax and epspasses were quite readily available too even though from then on there were quite visible steps towards tightening that flow some of the locals still have that impression of easy access and unlimited influx of foreign labor   globalization is also definitely a part of the problem and in fact a lot of this discourse is being replicated in many developed countries in their own forms and conflicts think a lot of the racism is actually just a fear of the unknown and fear of being displaced in their place of birthcomfort   have not seen any developed country solve this societal issue yet so it is still up in the air as to whether singapore will ever pull through this hopefully we can find a middle ground somewhere and it does bear to mind that everyone is just looking to survive and earn a living do not hate on the people even if you have issues with the immigration policies,first welcomed singapore please put comments might seen mind always remember online discourse always going minority portion population point made kind resonated explaining indians punching bag conversation right point low end jobs historically dominated indian workers might seeped social conscience increasing visibility highly paid indian workers make wonder class discrimination play hostility going conscious thing rather subconscious idea indian workers supposed lowpaid change status discomforts loud dissenters personal thought hangover displeasure white paper era immigration considered pretty lax epspasses quite readily available even though quite visible steps towards tightening flow locals still impression easy access unlimited influx foreign labor globalization also definitely part problem fact lot discourse replicated many developed countries forms conflicts think lot racism actually fear unknown fear displaced place birthcomfort seen developed country solve societal issue yet still air whether singapore ever pull hopefully find middle ground somewhere bear mind everyone looking survive earn living hate people even issues immigration policies,first welcomed singapore please put comments might seen mind always remember online discourse always going minority portion population point made kind resonated explaining indians punching bag conversation right point low end jobs historically dominated indian workers might seeped social conscience increasing visibility highly paid indian workers make wonder class discrimination play hostility going conscious thing rather subconscious idea indian workers supposed lowpaid change status discomforts loud dissenters personal thought hangover displeasure white paper era immigration considered pretty lax epspasses quite readily available even though quite visible steps towards tightening flow locals still impression easy access unlimited influx foreign labor globalization also definitely part problem fact lot discourse replicated many developed countries forms conflicts think lot racism actually fear unknown fear displaced place birthcomfort seen developed country solve societal issue yet still air whether singapore ever pull hopefully find middle ground somewhere bear mind everyone looking survive earn living hate people even issues immigration policies

The only way is for the non - Indian dominated Ministry of Manpower staff through invisible magic hand conspire to place Indian nationalities on top of others

You guys are good to understand what is happening to pipes in your house or what to do when circuit breaker trips down.Very difficult for you to understand , larger trends like economy, jobs , industries etc.

So it is comforting to rely on conspiracy theories

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,jowkeng,"I think we all should also tilt the spotlight back to the government and government policy. Enough ink has been spilled between different groups of people.

Singapore's immigration policy is really the lack of one. We bring in foreigners ""purely"" for the pragmatic reason of growing our economy without a view to assimilating into a citizen. It is not that hard to get an S-pass or EP but good luck getting a Citizenship to sink roots here unless you are James Dyson.

Worse, we seem to have a view towards ""setting aside"" different groups of industry /function for different nationalities. Ostensibly because different nationalities ""specialize"" in different areas. Indians in IT, Pinoy's in healthcare, Malaysians in blue collar and middle-back office (I stereotype here but pls bear with it).

Why should we be surprised if different nationalities end up cornering various parts of the economy?

Does it sound familiar? Well that was a big part of our Colonial history under the British - Divide and Rule. As a Singaporean Chinese I am aware that generations ago us Sporean Chinese did not have a collective identity but had deep stereotypes and cast aspersions about each other, (See Hokkien - Teochew riots). The colonial rulers ""brought in"" different groups of people for various purposes to suit their colonial enterprise, without ever  a long-term view to letting them settle permanently. To the effect that the different dialect groups ""owned"" different economic functions (ask your great-grandparents). 

There was also a hard fought struggle post WW2 during decolonization to obtain citizenship rights for everybody whom the British ""brought in"", while balancing the concerns and sensitivities of the native Bumis which pretty much had been left in poverty by the British.

An even harder struggle was to build a unique post-independence identity that could encompass everybody the British brought in as well as people who've been here since long ago. Given that the forces of Globalization have been unleashed perhaps we've lost some of that and need to rebuilt.

Undeniably, the British also used ""Divide and Rule"" to great effect in India, for better or for worse. Makes you wonder if the colonial policy DNA is still present today.

In my view unless we adopt a more ""pathway to citizenship"" immigration policy like what Canada, New Zealand, Australia does, local - foreigner divide will also be present in our society. The ""Us vs Them"" mentality in both locals and foreigners minds cannot be broken. This of course needs to be held in place by a stronger social safety net funded by all taxpayers so everyone has a stronger sense of social solidarity.

The government and how our government policies have been designed needs to shoulder alot of responsibility for how this has panned out. But this is a whole topic unto itself.

As others have have pointed out this anti-CECA is but the latest in a series of Us vs Them in our history, stretching back to when Raffles decided this place is great for colonial enterprise.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,deheuty,"By probability alone, Singapore, or any country in the world **cannot** compete with the global job market in terms of getting the best person for the job.

I think basically, a government of each country has to balance two objectives for their own country: how do they balance between economic growth obtained via open borders (i.e., allowing the best person from ANY country to apply for jobs in the country) versus preserving threats to nationality/national identity/nationalism etc?

I think the balance of these two priorities lies at the crux of this issue. Are we building a money making enterprise or are we building a nation? Is a nation just another money making enterprise or is money making a means to build a nation? Which is our priority? I think discussing how policies that can strike a balance between these two goals would be more constructive.

Presently, I think while the Singapore govt prioritises GDP **as** nation building, Singaporeans see it as a **means** to nation building and if it threatens our national identity (e.g., Singapore for Singaporeans) then the GDP making policies should be tweaked. So I see it as a conflict of priorities between the govt and the people it is trying to represent and govern.",Negative,1,1631971503,2021-09-18 13:25:03,"By probability alone, Singapore, or any country in the world **cannot** compete with the global job market in terms of getting the best person for the job.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,Silvsice,"The fundamental issue is that Singaporeans are being relatively screwed over in their own country. Lower salary, lower job stability, high cost of living, etc...

If you substitute CECA with some other foreign agreement like with PRC, Mexico or Russia, you'll see a lot of the same resentment because they are angry about being treated like low class citizens.

There will always be cultural clashes especially when people who come over don't adhere to the social norms and behaviours. But making this entire issue solely based off racial prejudice is a smokescreen to what's actually happening.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,throw_way772,"> How else do you explain the flood of Indian nationals into our island to the extent that at one point, our cinemas were showing so many Hindi movies

Hindi movies were screened in Singapore before the country became independent from the British Empire. They were called Hindustani movies back then, and Malays and Sikhs were the main clientele. Just ask your Malay friends about Raj Kapoor or Shammi Kapoor. They confirm chop will know one.

The ignorance and tunnel vision of some ethnocentrists on this sub knows no bounds. Just because you don't do ABC or watch XYZ doesn't mean it's an imported trend. Singapore =/= China.

> The only diff is that nationals of the other 2 FTA countries have not flooded our island unlike India which has seen a 500% increase in EP holders since 2010.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,kihtrak256,">While I know lower-wage workers do not get EPs and nor are their occupations relevant to CECA I just want to highlight this observation. This is partly the reason why I think there is a racial element to the whole CECA issue.

Again, I mentioned that CECA did not apply to migrant workers so I was not saying that there are construction jobs open that locals can take. What point I was trying to make was that locals have no problem with foreigners doing tasks in sectors where they don't have manpower/desire to do such as construction etc. but they are especially mindful of foreigners, especially Indians, taking the PMETs. I was trying to highlight the racial aspect of this issue.  
Think about it. You grow up seeing South Asians doing menial work. Whether you want to or not you end up having this prejudice ""South Asians are fit only for construction"" and then you grow up and see South Asians, more specifically Indians, take over a lucrative field. You begin to question, ""How can these people do better than me?"". The same would not apply for Chinese or Caucasians because the Chinese are similar to the vast majority such that they may be able to pass off as Singaporean.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,kihtrak256,">Type so much just to validate that Indians have more 'Professionals' for IT job?. and 2ndly comparing about chinese and indians because Indians english is better because they have been colonized.

I was explaining why Indians are preferred over Mainland Chinese. We have English speaking advantage and in no place did I mention our English is better than Singaporean English.

>Singapore education is better and we provide English lesson more competitive than in India. Your country being colonized doesn't mean your english is better than us. It's subjective to each person whether they are willing to learn it or not. and tbh English is not the primary reason needed to work in IT. Don't have to brag about english, IT is very systematic and more to problem-solving.

See point above. You still need to learn English to communicate with colleagues. You can do the job well but cant communicate that just messes up the system.

>Indians can get fake certification till they make it into the job. What kind of bullshit professionalism are you bragging about?. Singapore hire lecturers for thousand of dollars who are really expert in their field and provide from basic to advance knowledge with business samples, but yes I can admit our education system may be slow at times as IT fastly evolved..

I never say that Indian education is better (explicitly make that clear) nor do I say that we are more professional. And contrary to popular belief majority of Indians dont buy degrees. Only recognised, well known universities are respected abroad. Others dont get foreign jobs just with their degree, they work in India, gain some experience then move to other places. My point with that entire paragraph was the surge in Indians is not due to CECA, its due to globalisation. 

Your comment basically shows you haven't read my post carefully and you're just jumping to conclusions that suit your prejudice. Even after explicitly stating this surge is not due to Indian superiority in any skill, rather its a consequence of globalisation and abundance of supply, you still make the conclusions you want to make.",Positive,1,1631768761,2021-09-16 05:06:01,"I was explaining why Indians are preferred over Mainland Chinese.

>While I know lower-wage workers do not get EPs and nor are their occupations relevant to CECA I just want to highlight this observation. This is partly the reason why I think there is a racial element to the whole CECA issue.

I acknowledge that foreign workers are not included in CECA. The point Im trying to make is that the entire problem is due to the fact that the jobs are going to Indians. Suppose if the jobs went to Singaporean Indians there would still be uproar. But if it went to Chinese or Caucasians no one would bat an eye. 

Why? Think about it. You grow up seeing South Asians doing menial work. Whether you want to or not you end up having this prejudice ""South Asians are fit only for construction"" and then you grow up and see South Asians, more specifically Indians, take over a lucrative field. You begin to question, ""How can these people do better than me?"".

I was explaining why Indians are preferred over Mainland Chinese. We have English speaking advantage and in no place did I mention our English is better than Singaporean English.


See point above. You still need to learn English to communicate with colleagues. You can do the job well but cant communicate that just messes up the system.


I never say that Indian education is better (explicitly make that clear) nor do I say that we are more professional. And contrary to popular belief majority of Indians dont buy degrees. Only recognised, well known universities are respected abroad. Others dont get foreign jobs just with their degree, they work in India, gain some experience then move to other places. My point with that entire paragraph was the surge in Indians is not due to CECA, its due to globalisation. 

Your comment basically shows you haven't read my post carefully and you're just jumping to conclusions that suit your prejudice. Even after explicitly stating this surge is not due to Indian superiority in any skill, rather its a consequence of globalisation and abundance of supply, you still make the conclusions you want to make.",i was explaining why indians are preferred over mainland chinese we have english speaking advantage and in no place did i mention our english is better than singaporean english   see point above you still need to learn english to communicate with colleagues you can do the job well but cant communicate that just messes up the system   i never say that indian education is better explicitly make that clear nor do i say that we are more professional and contrary to popular belief majority of indians dont buy degrees only recognised well known universities are respected abroad others dont get foreign jobs just with their degree they work in india gain some experience then move to other places my point with that entire paragraph was the surge in indians is not due to ceca its due to globalisation   your comment basically shows you have not read my post carefully and you are just jumping to conclusions that suit your prejudice even after explicitly stating this surge is not due to indian superiority in any skill rather its a consequence of globalisation and abundance of supply you still make the conclusions you want to make,explaining indians preferred mainland chinese english speaking advantage place mention english better singaporean english see point still need learn english communicate colleagues job well cant communicate messes system never say indian education better explicitly make clear say professional contrary popular belief majority indians dont buy degrees recognised well known universities respected abroad others dont get foreign jobs degree work india gain experience move places point entire paragraph surge indians due ceca due globalisation comment basically shows read post carefully jumping conclusions suit prejudice even explicitly stating surge due indian superiority skill rather consequence globalisation abundance supply still make conclusions want make,explaining indians preferred mainland chinese english speaking advantage place mention english better singaporean english see point still need learn english communicate colleagues job well cant communicate messes system never say indian education better explicitly make clear say professional contrary popular belief majority indians dont buy degrees recognised well known universities respected abroad others dont get foreign jobs degree work india gain experience move places point entire paragraph surge indians due  due globalisation comment basically shows read post carefully jumping conclusions suit prejudice even explicitly stating surge due indian superiority skill rather consequence globalisation abundance supply still make conclusions want make

Fully agreed. This is something many redditors are probably too young to remember. Xenophobia against PRC ladies was very real, in tandem with the influx of PRC nationals in the late 90s early 2000s.

PRC men were also being discriminated against. But PRC women bore the brunt of being seen as both **job** stealers and **husband** stealers.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,Educational-Toe6795,">Not long ago, the Govt opened the floodgates to PRCs and there was similar anti-foreigner sentiment against PRCs.

Lol..This is just racism masquerading as culturism ...Indians are culturally inferior because of a,b.c traits. It might even sound statistically right because in every community there will be some sample of people exhibiting traits.. Are you sure Chinese Singaporeans don't backstab at work or play politics? Heck no and you are kidding yourselves..Lack of courtesy..My goodness ..The umpteen situation where locals exhibited ""courtesy"" is every where to be seen..

Villager traits -- My god..People of my generation have not forgotten most ads mentioning ""mandarin required "" ..What is that?

By your logic, Europeans considered 100 years before Chinese to be innately less intelligent , less enterprising and less moralistic..Tell me who is right?

""Less arrogant"" and ""self aware"" all these show sense of loss of self esteem...

Note that local superiority doesn't mean objective superiority...Indians do better than Chinese and much better than the cream of Singaporeans who migrate in countries like US, UK and Australia where the discrimination is less...A nadella or pichai are possible there and less doubtful in Singapore. India will also be a 10 trillion economy in a decade or so

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,melancholysg29,">It's not going to be a conscious thing, but rather, a subconscious idea that Indian workers were supposed to be low-paid, and that a change in that status discomforts some of these loud dissenters. 

You just need to go into the forums that complain about Indians taking over Condo to get a feel. Many outright display their racism with comments like, ""The Indians stink our Condo"", ""How can we allow them to take over from ""us"""", ""We need to take back what is ours"""" or ""We must have EIP in Condo"". 

Not entirely surprising, since LKY had long seeded the idea among Singaporeans, that the country's economy is sustained by the Chinese and that if the Indians were majority, Singapore would have sunk. So there is a certain chauvanism that is at play too, I would say.

There still are some SME bosses that think Indian workers are only good for manual work. They will justify their racism and stereotypes by saying, ""We need to give the right job to the right person to find success"". I have experiance with some part time job agencies, that will call me for interview for an office job that I'm qualified for and pays $15/hr, and tell me thereafter, that the job has been taken. Instead, they will offer me a warehouse job that pays $7/hr. 

Having said that, I have also heard from many SG Indian friends of mine in recent year, of how they are frustrated because of the cultural clashes such as the caste system being brought in or how some Indians are attempting to undermine Tamil as the Official Language by introducing Hindi in public spaces and workspaces.

And being a devil's advocate here now. How much of the problems we face, is actually because of how we have curated an artifical sense of nationhood, out of a City?

I never say that Indian education is better (explicitly make that clear) nor do I say that we are more professional. And contrary to popular belief majority of Indians dont buy degrees.

It's not often I see/meet someone saying they could be doing jobs others are doing. If it does happen (people thinking they are more qualified than they really are) then it's no different than any other country. 

However, there are so many Singaporeans who keep assuming there must be other Singaporeans who are qualified enough to do the jobs foreigners do. Somehow it's become this narrative - how is it possible that nobody in Singapore can do these jobs. But the reality is, that is exactly what is happening in the job market. Singapore keeps creating jobs of a certain type (white collar managerial jobs), which no country's population is capable of fulfilling. This is not a reflection of SG people's ability, no country by itself will be able to fill the requirements of the jobs market SG creates.

The problem is that the jobs for people not wanting to be in the rat race or who are less able (the bottom 50%) do not have access to reasonably paying jobs that other rich countries have. 

If you guys try to force MNCs or big companies to hire the bottom 50-60%, they will simply stop coming here. There might be a 5 year phase where companies with existing operations can't leave immediately, so they stick around until they have to. And people make merry for those 5 years.

You never state mainland chinese. What you did state is ""Chinese"". please have some thoughts before you correct me. As Singapore is mainly populated by chinese, how are we supposed to know that you are comparing our english?. To be honest the debate here with CECA is because of fake degree and somehow they are accepted and more qualified than local Singaporean. There's no relation at all with mainland china, it's all about local jobs getting taken by foreigner.
  

  
I don't get why mainland china people have to be input for competition in taking local jobs?. I do see some of automotive developer from china and they can perform and write scripts well. Although their English may be weak, they are competent for the job and mostly local here can speak with them with Chinese language

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,HedonisticSwine,"Your argument here is just flawed. You are (1) asking us to imagine a scenario which did/has not occurred, and (2) predicting the psyche that Singaporeans will have towards that scenario. Both of this is highly unfair arguments to make. 

(1) While you might want us to imagine that scenario, the fact is that this is not the problem at hand. The problem we are addressing is the influx of Indians taking PMET jobs, not Caucasians, not Chinese. So stick to the original scenario and don't distract reader (or yourself) from what is currently at play. 

(2) Even if we grant you that and imagine that scenario, it still doesn't give you the right to say ""this is how you will feel"". You are not us and more importantly, you are trying the generalize the entire population by making such accusations. The bigger issue here is, why do you think that is how we will respond? Just as how you perceived Singaporeans have judged the Indians, you too have judged us (without concrete evidence, I might add). 

Please don't make such arguments. Just stick to facts and your feelings; those I can respect. But when you try to project onto Singaporeans, that's where you are not making sound arguments.

Sg invested in groomimg their population towards finance / business but not technology. During the same time, India groomed its resources in Tech. Because of the population and the affinity to technology any skill shortage anywhere can be plugged by looking into India.
If you go to a shop to buy something either you pay whatever is written on the price tag or try to get a goo deal. It is the same with MNCs. Why would they pay for training someone when they could get someone job ready.
Again the point of contention is, if the MNCs bring in folks from elsewhere in exchange they create roles for the locals too. If there is too much force on the MNCs for them it is very easy to shift jobs elsewhere. India offers very good real estate and savings to them. It would just be a matter of time.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,ShadeX8,"My opinion that our economical focus and success is actually our downfall in this area. The chase for money, success, material goods, status and the idea of the 'good life' makes us forget that we're all human beings but instead, treat each other as either rivals or dirt by the road. 

Empathy.

Community.

Respect.

Tolerance.

Understanding.

All these goes by the wayside for the pursuit for 'success'. Is it a true success though? Or just a transient thing that actually sows the seed for our collective downfall?

We're still in the grand experiment of society called capitalism, and globalization and its effects is just a phase in this.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,throw_way772,"Okay, I don’t wanna be hotheaded because that will get us nowhere, so let me explain. 

Just like the Chinese community has several dialect groups, the Indian community has several linguistic groups. Tamil, Malayalam, Punjabi, Bengali, and Hindi have been the 5 most dominant Indian languages here (in rough descending order) since Raffles founded the colony. There are substantial numbers of non-Tamil Singaporean Indians in the community that have long, long ancestral history here, just as long as anyone else.

Your friend is right that there is more difference between a Tamil and Hindi speaker (completely different languages) than a Canto and Teochew speaker (mildly different variations of Chinese) but in the context of Singapore we are all Singaporean and the divisions in our ancestral homeland shouldn’t matter here.

I don’t blame you for not knowing much because our dumb education system omits a lot of information about our history, but Google is free. Pritam Singh, Kishore Mahbubani, Subhas Anandan, Hri Kumar Nair, Inderjit Singh, Sivakant Tiwari, Davinder Singh, to name a few: all famous non-Tamil-speaking Indian Singaporeans.

The four official languages do not paint the full picture. There is no Hokkien or Canto or Arabic or Javanese or Punjabi or Hindi in the official languages list but they are every bit as “Singaporean” as Mandarin or Tamil.

Back to movies: Until the early 2010s most Indian movies in Singapore (of all languages) were screened in smaller independent cinemas in Little India or Shaw Tower. These small Indian cinemas gradually wound down operations or went out of business entirely, so GV swooped in and took over the screenings.

I'm not going to get back the 2 years, but I served to play my part in keeping the country safe for my family and friends.

I will say this, those who think that men who complain about NS are incompetent, are very wrong. Try serving in a shiong combat unit both as a NSF and NSmen for 10+2 years of your life and you'll realise that the sacrifice is substantial. NS tax should be a thing for foreigners imo.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,ShadeX8,"You're right in saying everyone has preconceived perceptions about others. Stereotyping of people is inbuilt and no matter how much you try to fight it, it creeps into your consciousness and stays there.

I think the key is to recognize that the stereotyping exists, and recognize that it might not be necessarily true for every person you meet of that race/religion/sex/age. What defines a person? Thoughts or action? If everyone's defined by what they think, in religious terms, everyone's going to hell. 

The worst thing one can do is to recognize that they have an existing stereotype in their mind and just doubles down on it, like you were doing in your first post. You know as well as I do, that not all Indians are noisy and arrogant. You cognitively understand that their behavior has been molded by their environment and that it would take a very long time to get out of habits born of decades.

Then whats the point of posting this thread here? Might as well find a forum that have people who think like you so all of you can just circlejerk around it. 

And let me say this, we have no qualms of Singaporean Indians taking over whatever job positions. I've seen you saying that there'll still be an uproar amongst the Chinese... Sorry, thats absolute bullshit. You know nothing.

Edit: Continue to have this mindset of yours, nothing will change even if u stay here for another 10 years because you are literally proving people their point about such issues.",it is my perspective  well that sums it up is not it you came here for only a mere  years no idea how intergral you are to the local community  you hold such strong narrow onesided stance towards the ceca issue pull up some proper data to back your claims   like others have commented and come up with the common sentiments many locals have been feeling you are simply dodging them  only like what you want to see because that is how you feel then whats the point of posting this thread here might as well find a forum that have people who think like you so all of you can just circlejerk around it   and let me say this we have no qualms of singaporean indians taking over whatever job positions i have seen you saying that there will still be an uproar amongst the chinese sorry thats absolute bullshit you know nothing  edit continue to have this mindset of yours nothing will change even if u stay here for another  years because you are literally proving people their point about such issues,perspective well sums came mere years idea intergral local community hold strong narrow onesided stance towards ceca issue pull proper data back claims like others commented come common sentiments many locals feeling simply dodging like want see feel whats point posting thread might well find forum people think like circlejerk around let say qualms singaporean indians taking whatever job positions seen saying still uproar amongst chinese sorry thats absolute bullshit know nothing edit continue mindset nothing change even u stay another years literally proving people point issues,perspective well sums came mere years idea intergral local community hold strong narrow onesided stance towards  issue pull proper data back claims like others commented come common sentiments many locals feeling simply dodging like want see feel whats point posting thread might well find forum people think like circlejerk around let say qualms singaporean indians taking whatever job positions seen saying still uproar amongst chinese sorry thats absolute bullshit know nothing edit continue mindset nothing change even u stay another years literally proving people point issues

1. Like you are underwhelmed by Indians in SG, many corporates are underwhelmed by Singaporean talent. They have shared with government many times esp their ability to question/challenge.
2. if Indians leave it is of no consequence to India/Indians and also for Singapore except might be for some flux

On. broader points

1. Have you ever seen a grab or Uber drive happy? 
2. VCs are smarter than you and me because it is their money / risks
3. Go to the future and see the learning that India and China would have had due to failures at others expense like US had in dotcom era

On caste point, When you say Indian is it Hindu, Muslim or Christian ? Goan , maharastian or parsis? Nouveau rich or middle class as in Singapore? What do you mean by caste? All too hazy

If I compare with class divide in Singapore between super rich and poor then most Indian discrimination will look feeble esp when the law has abolished any discrimination . In Singapore people you can discriminate by class and still it is completely legal but in India you will go to jail

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,souna313313,"> Like you are underwhelmed by Indians in SG, many corporates are underwhelmed by Singaporean talent. They have shared with government many times esp their ability to question/challenge.

In my corner of things, I'd rather have unthinking Singaporeans who can execute tasks properly instead of barely competent Indian nationals who think they know better and FUBAR tasks assigned to them. 

> Have you ever seen a grab or Uber drive happy? 

Nope. Though in the hotel business this is diametrically different.

There are owners who've had partnerships with traditional hotel operators like Marriott or IHG for *decades* and steadily came to add more properties to their portfolio because of this. The key difference with OYO is OYO pitches to people: ""Do you want to be a hotelier instead of an Uber driver"" and treats owners like they're Uber drivers. The nature of the relationship is completely one-sided and this is why OYO will never make it beyond the economy market segment. This ends up stunting OYO's long-term outlook when the post-2008 hospitality market has made the mid-tier segment between economy and 4-stars the most profitable one for decades to come.",,1,1631827496,2021-09-16 21:24:56,"

Agreed. I can't deny there's a substantial subset of Indians that are just plain annoying and refuse to change

> c) The spark would not have turn into a fire if not for the friction between the locals and foreigners. The fractions contributed to the heat and fuel the emotion.

I don't think there's any friction directly. In fact, I barely see any interaction between locals and foreigners at all. That's actually part of the problem

Rather, the dissatisfaction with CECA is a symptom of a larger problem related to disillusionment and class issues. CECA and foreigners are an easy target to lash out against when there is deep rooted dissatisfaction with one's position in life and when there is perceived inequity. People feel that things are unfair, and they latch onto something that is easy to target and get supporters behind. 

If the government is smart, the REAL challenge is not to convince people about the merits and myths of CECA, it is to diagnose the underlying root causes of dissatisfaction and fix the social contract which binds society.

Did CECA result in higher unemployment? Absolutely not.

Did CECA suppress wages? Absolutely not. Median wages across all percentiles and income brackets have beaten inflation over the past decade. Something that a lot of developed countries have not managed to do.

Did CECA cause underemployment? 

1. There are now more Singaporean citizens who are PMETs in % and absolute terms than a decade ago

2. If the median wages across all percentiles are beating inflation, it's statistically extremely improbable that underemployment is rising.

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",pzshx2002,"Depressed wages, 'quantity over quality' talent coming here and the lack of integration of foreigners and locals are the main issues I observe on the ground over the years which have made us come to witness this debate today in 2021.

Like most have said here, we are well aware of globalisation and I believe many of us appreciate that we are well connected with the rest of the world and MNCs are able to come to our country to create quality jobs and we are able to attract talented people to come and make meaningful contributions to our country.

The first problem is pay stagnation. I have a short working career (15 years) and I have worked in a global eng mnc before. While I am not aware of the job market rate now for fresh uni grads, I was offered 2.5k during the mid 2000s when I was a fresh uni grad. In 2021, I am still seeing less than 2k offered for uni grads at job sites now, so it is quite sad to see that. With rising costs of living, it is not surprising to see talented people moving overseas to work or hopping on to more lucrative industries. Raising wages for locals will help our talented grads stay here.

The 'quantity over quality' could well apply to everyone including locals but just looking at the Changi Business Park case study today, we understand why OYK said some have mentioned we had lost a part of Singapore. Within companies, there may be certain groups of workers from certain countries too. It could be due to the hiring manager or just familiarity of the workers who like to work with people with the same nationality.  I experienced that while working in the mnc and while most of the foreigners I worked with are decent, honest workers, a few unfortunately just do not make the grade. Thus, vetting the quality of workers coming in is important and I hope companies should hire people on merit and not because they are 'low cost'. (e.g. 2 foreigners over one local). For sure, the talented foreigner will help complement our local workforce.

The last point is integration. While I was working in the mnc, I was able to communicate well with my dept colleagues, which were a mix of locals and foreigners when I first joined. But slowly over the years, I witnessed some of my local colleagues moving on to other depts or other companies. Finally I was the only local left in my dept until I left my company a few years ago. Many of my colleagues starting talking more in their local dialect in the office and slowly we had lost common topics to talk about. My work which is project related didn't helped at all as some of them had to travel for projects and had their own families after work. Thus there was a lack of bonding and the office gradually became 'cold'. While this is my own personal experience, I feel it could be happening in other companies too. 

One way I see to improve this situation is volunteering activities to integrate locals and foreigners. But it depends on the companies and I have noticed that volunteering rates are low among working PMETs (the biggest groups I have witnessed in events are students getting CIP points and retired seniors)

To end off, I would like to say if we could improve on the 3 points above, I feel locals will be more accepting of globalisation (CECA or other FTAs) happening on our shores.",,9,1625666914,2021-07-07 14:08:34,"Depressed wages, 'quantity over quality' talent coming here and the lack of integration of foreigners and locals are the main issues I observe on the ground over the years which have made us come to witness this debate today in 2021.

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",epimeliad,"Let me offer some counter perspectives

>As mentioned in parliament, and of official government records, let's reiterate that CECA does not allow the free movement of natural persons (i.e. immigration).

Under [chapter 9](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/non-financial-assistance/for-companies/free-trade-agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/Chapter9_Movement_of_Natural_Persons) Singaporeans and Indians are granted entry to India and Singapore for various periods (2month to 3 years). In terms of competition, you do not need immigration to increase the number of people able to work in a region.

The main concern about **temporary** foreign workers is 2 fold:

1. Remittance - which means capital is not recirculated in the economy leading to a less than expected money multiplier. This means the economy may not benefit as much if locals were hired since local spending would spend more in the local economy than foreign workers
2. Path dependence - by hiring foreign workers, we ignore the more important question of developing the local workforce. Business may choose to simply get foreign workers and not invest in technology/schooling to train the next generation.Taken to the extreme, this means a continued dependency on foreign labor because we lack the infrastructure to shift to a local workforce even when cost of foreign worker increase to match the local workforce.

For a country like Singapore where we are already liberal in terms of trade, additional FTA has a diminishing impact on the benefits. Most of the gains from FDI for instance would not have much spillovers.

That is not to say the net impact of CECA is negative, in fact, I believe it is the opposite, but currently, we have too little data to make any conclusion on the magnitude of the impact.",,9,1625646964,2021-07-07 08:36:04,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics#:~:text=Far%2Dright%20politics%2C%20also%20referred,having%20nativist%20ideologies%20and%20tendencies.

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",owlbunnysubway,"I am glad this post is up. I want to share my thoughts on this. Whether I'm right, wrong, or misguided is not material to me, so I will be disabling inbox responses. I just want to get some stuff off my chest. 

I am both happy and disturbed that there are those who seek to defend PSP and/or continue to lambast CECA for what it is not. Happy, because based on what little they can cobble up, I know that they know, in their heart of hearts, that their position is indefensible. They *know*, and that is why they cling to minor objections like ""If the Government released the numbers earlier, it'd have put to rest all these concerns!"" or ""They're not hearing the cries of the people!""

They *know* that they lost the point, and hence why they shift goalposts, accuse gaslighting, get mired in pedantry, and otherwise struggle with trying to find some coherent ground to stand on. 

But I am also disturbed. Because this is the reaction from what is an intellectually dishonest group of people - and I don't care that they are intellectually dishonest to others. I feel sad and disappointed that they are intellectually dishonest to themselves. They cannot reconcile the disjunction in their brain and ""lived experiences"" with the statistics and data placed before them, and as such try to concoct means and ways to make sense of it all. And the outcome they reach is that *it's someone else's fault*. Conveniently, the Government's. Less conveniently but still the same, the Indian FTs'. The list goes on - but at no point will they receive the tragic but comforting release of looking themselves in the mirror. 

For example - to the redditor who claimed that your supplier hired an Indian instead of a local, why didn't you change supplier? Why didn't you protest the injustice of it all, and put your money where your mouth is? If it wasn't your decision - why didn't you protest your boss's complicity and quit? *You know why*. And if you were even an ounce more honest with yourself, you would've known why you didn't bother asking your supplier *why he hired an Indian* and tried to understand what pains he was going through. And if you were two ounces more honest with yourself, you would know that there is a wide gap of responsibility between Government policy and what business decisions your supplier takes. 

But you don't. You instead tout him as an example about how CECA BAD. 

The ills of globalization are not new to anyone paying any semblance of attention. Xenophobia and nationalism has been on the rise since, roughly, the mid-2000s. The US just concluded 4 years of a presidency where they flirted with the idea of anti-intellectual governance for the sake of ""sticking it to the Man"". Brexit *actually* occurred. In Japan, hikikomori-ism is a significant social issue. In China, 躺平 is the new buzzword. 

The effects of an open, global economic market where labour competition is not confined to one's national boundaries are recent phenomena - but the trend and reactions are not dissimilar. 

It is no wonder that Singaporeans feel unsafe. But the fact of the matter is *no one feels safe* - and by no one, I mean *literally no one in any mature economy*. People who can compete, thrive in an environment where their strengths are maximised and weaknesses minimised; conversely, people who can't compete, will stack up at the wrong end of the distribution curve. 

This is known. This is not news. It is sobering, tragic, disheartening - but it is not news. 

I can say with some compassion that I understand why people will lash out and seek someone to blame. It is a thoroughly bitter pill to swallow, when the pill has on its casing ""You're not good enough"". The mental backlash is not easy to accept, and it is no wonder that people will seek easy answers - even if they know, deep down, that those answers are wrong. 

What, then? Because the alternative - accepting that life is suffering and we're all doomed - seems to be horrible, yes? 

I think we should start by being honest with ourselves. And I mean *brutally* honest. Those who are blessed to work in/with MNCs or foreigners know how hungry some of these foreigners are. Anecdotally, I know Taiwanese entrepreneurs who come to Singapore to set up companies, not because they don't believe in the Taiwan Dream, but because it's easier to get a Singapore company marketed. *To leave their home, families, and loved ones to pursue a chance of success* - that is the type of hunger and thirst that we, as economic units, have to come up against. 

So at the individual level, those who can, must fight. We have to do what we can to be able to tell ourselves, ""at least we tried"". If that means holding our noses and taking the SkillsFuture credits to do what little reskilling we can, that's what it takes. If it means going on networking sessions to simultaneously put ourselves out there but also to figure out where new business niches may come up - and then putting in the work to get that out there - then that's what it takes. Another anecdote - a few years ago, a friend was telling me about a business plan, trying to bring quality tea to the masses (think bubble tea but with proper brewed tea). He never acted on the idea. Now, there are a number of outfits who purport to put that idea out there. Is that a missed opportunity? Is my friend someone who never tried? Does he look at those outfits and wonder to himself? 

Can we each make choices that will let us sleep at night without wondering to ourselves, ""have we tried our best?"" 

But I am also aware - at the end of the day, it is the minority of the minority who will succeed. Most people are not able to put themselves through the struggles of business or job creation and suffer while not lamenting failure. They may have real reasons why they can't - a mortgage, a family, a phobia, a lack of resources and/or know-how. 

And that's fine. 

My comfort is that the ability of mature economies to support hikikomoris or people who are ""lying flat"" is an indication that on a macro level, we're doing alright. There are options for people who can only or choose only to eke out a subsistence level of living. That's not to say that we should all resign our fate to that - but it is a social safety net to know that there are options out there that let people survive while figuring a way out. And furthermore, life is not about chasing the dollar, the fanciest car, or the most glamourous house. So it is actually okay, if we end up not being able to dine in a Michelin-star restaurant or live in Queen Astrid Park. There is a wide spectrum between subsistence level survival and the 0.1%. 

So long as we're honest to ourselves, and we lead a life of what we choose to strive towards based on an honest assessment of ourselves, I think that's good enough. And our economy can sustain that (thus far). So we aren't in an apocalyptic stage. 

Just please. Be honest. Stop blaming others for no fault of theirs. The fact of the matter is that this is no one's fault. It is simply what it is.",,4,1625642739,2021-07-07 07:25:39,"I am glad this post is up. I want to share my thoughts on this.

What I like to find out is the number of Employment Passes (EP) given out in a year and how does it compare to what other countries are doing. I'm using the H1B visas in the US as a point of reference, and while not entirely apples to apples, i think it is close. 

The H1B visas are non-immigrant visas that allow firms to bring in skilled workers/professions for jobs that they cannot find a US resident to fill. Information about H1B visas can be found here: [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations) . The H1B visa seems most similar to EP in Singapore. It's not limited to the tech industry, although i would guess the majority of the visas are given out to tech workers. It has an annual quota of 85,000 (info in the link) new visas every year. As a percentage of the US population, that's minuscule, but that's not a fair comparison since Singapore is a city state. Instead, I like to restrict the population to just the tech hubs in the US. The Bay Area (silicon valley) has a population of 7+ mil. The Seattle metropolitan area (Amazon, Microsoft and others) has a population of 3.9 mil. Austin has a population of 0.9 mil. New York city has a population of 8+ mil. For New York city, there is a wide range of professions and tech jobs may be in the minority. However, quite a number of H1B visa holders also work in finance, so let's assume 50% of the jobs there will employ H1B holders. This gives us an effective population of 4+ mil for New York City. Taken in total, the overall population becomes 15.8 mil. This is probably a conservative estimate since it leaves out places like Chicago city, Florida and the LA metropolitan area, which includes, for example, Qualcomm in San Diego.

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",notsocoolnow,"Gonna be honest here: the reason we resent globalization is that the increased competition from foreign talent doesn't come with a corresponding increase in pay to match foreign companies.

Our government policies are constantly depressing the cost of employees here, to the point where we've got 40% foreign talent which is around that of New York, yet our salaries are nowhere near that of New York salaries.

The probability to an individual of having side effects is low, but the impact is potentially very high.  But if people don't take the vaccine, society as a whole will suffer.  

The answer is for policymakers to *ignore individual incentives*.  We already do that for vaccines other than Covid, which has escaped being made mandatory because it is new enough that the potential impacts are still unknown.  The same will go for CECA and FTAs - a policymaker must consider the good of society as a whole, not just individuals.

Glad to hear that your situation has improved now.

I had similar experiences as you while working in a global mnc few years ago. As I was in the eng field, most of my colleagues were from SEA, China and India. 

While I respect my colleagues and get on well with them, over time the relationship may change. Especially when we are the only local left in the dept. Like you, I also felt like a foreigner in my own country.

I personally experienced the meetings like you and also hear my colleagues speaking in their own dialects during work. During lunch, they would eat with their colleagues from other dept( same nationality too) and after work, they would go home as most of them had their own families. Another roadblock was that they had brought their own lunchbox (prepared at home due to their diet) and very very seldom go out to eat at hawker centers too. Of course this is my own experience and may not apply to other people.

So I thought to myself...when is a good time for us to interact informally? 

Most of my colleagues were decent family people who came to work only and normally don't go out to socialise unnecessary. These were two aspects which I admire.

Maybe it was also due to my introverted personality but over time, we lost common topics to talk about and the office gradually became 'cold'. When the time came to move on, I quitted.

While I am glad to see this topic being debated, I am grateful for the opportunities offered in a mnc when I was working with them and I also learnt a great deal from them too. No doubt they help to complement our local workforce and have better technical working experiences/conversation skills.

I stress that I am still on good terms with my ex colleagues, but working day by day with each other, it sure doesn't feel like I was working in Singapore. So to end off, I hope that moving forward, there has to be some balance in our FTAs and also more robust company policies so it doesn't result in too many incoming workers from one country only and alienating the locals.",,6,1625668620,2021-07-07 14:37:00,"Thanks for sharing your experiences and sorry to hear about your wife's discrimination.

I personally experienced the meetings like you and also hear my colleagues speaking in their own dialects during work. During lunch, they would eat with their colleagues from other dept( same nationality too) and after work, they would go home as most of them had their own families. Another roadblock was that they had brought their own lunchbox (prepared at home due to their diet) and very very seldom go out to eat at hawker centers too. Of course this is my own experience and may not apply to other people.

So I thought to myself...when is a good time for us to interact informally? 

Most of my colleagues were decent family people who came to work only and normally don't go out to socialise unnecessary. These were two aspects which I admire.

Maybe it was also due to my introverted personality but over time, we lost common topics to talk about and the office gradually became 'cold'. When the time came to move on, I quitted.

While I am glad to see this topic being debated, I am grateful for the opportunities offered in a mnc when I was working with them and I also learnt a great deal from them too. No doubt they help to complement our local workforce and have better technical working experiences/conversation skills.

I stress that I am still on good terms with my ex colleagues, but working day by day with each other, it sure doesn't feel like I was working in Singapore. So to end off, I hope that moving forward, there has to be some balance in our FTAs and also more robust company policies so it doesn't result in too many incoming workers from one country only and alienating the locals.",thanks for sharing your experiences and sorry to hear about your wife is discrimination glad to hear that your situation has improved now  i had similar experiences as you while working in a global mnc few years ago as i was in the eng field most of my colleagues were from sea china and india   while i respect my colleagues and get on well with them over time the relationship may change especially when we are the only local left in the dept like you i also felt like a foreigner in my own country  i personally experienced the meetings like you and also hear my colleagues speaking in their own dialects during work during lunch they would eat with their colleagues from other dept same nationality too and after work they would go home as most of them had their own families another roadblock was that they had brought their own lunchbox prepared at home due to their diet and very very seldom go out to eat at hawker centers too of course this is my own experience and may not apply to other people  so i thought to myselfwhen is a good time for us to interact informally   most of my colleagues were decent family people who came to work only and normally do not go out to socialise unnecessary these were two aspects which i admire  maybe it was also due to my introverted personality but over time we lost common topics to talk about and the office gradually became cold when the time came to move on i quitted  while i am glad to see this topic being debated i am grateful for the opportunities offered in a mnc when i was working with them and i also learnt a great deal from them too no doubt they help to complement our local workforce and have better technical working experiencesconversation skills  i stress that i am still on good terms with my ex colleagues but working day by day with each other it sure does not feel like i was working in singapore so to end off i hope that moving forward there has to be some balance in our ftas and also more robust company policies so it does not result in too many incoming workers from one country only and alienating the locals,thanks sharing experiences sorry hear wife discrimination glad hear situation improved similar experiences working global mnc years ago eng field colleagues sea china india respect colleagues get well time relationship may change especially local left dept like also felt like foreigner country personally experienced meetings like also hear colleagues speaking dialects work lunch would eat colleagues dept nationality work would go home families another roadblock brought lunchbox prepared home due diet seldom go eat hawker centers course experience may apply people thought myselfwhen good time us interact informally colleagues decent family people came work normally go socialise unnecessary two aspects admire maybe also due introverted personality time lost common topics talk office gradually became cold time came move quitted glad see topic debated grateful opportunities offered mnc working also learnt great deal doubt help complement local workforce better technical working experiencesconversation skills stress still good terms ex colleagues working day day sure feel like working singapore end hope moving forward balance ftas also robust company policies result many incoming workers one country alienating locals,thanks sharing experiences sorry hear wife discrimination glad hear situation improved similar experiences working global mnc years ago eng field colleagues sea china india respect colleagues get well time relationship may change especially local left dept like also felt like foreigner country personally experienced meetings like also hear colleagues speaking dialects work lunch would eat colleagues dept nationality work would go home families another roadblock brought lunchbox prepared home due diet seldom go eat hawker centers course experience may apply people thought myselfwhen good time us interact informally colleagues decent family people came work normally go socialise unnecessary two aspects admire maybe also due introverted personality time lost common topics talk office gradually became cold time came move quitted glad see topic debated grateful opportunities offered mnc working also learnt great deal doubt help complement local workforce better technical working experiencesconversation skills stress still good terms ex colleagues working day day sure feel like working singapore end hope moving forward balance ftas also robust company policies result many incoming workers one country alienating locals

It's not often I see/meet someone saying they could be doing jobs others are doing.

However, there are so many Singaporeans who keep assuming there must be other Singaporeans who are qualified enough to do the jobs foreigners do. Somehow it's become this narrative - how is it possible that nobody in Singapore can do these jobs. But the reality is, that is exactly what is happening in the job market. Singapore keeps creating jobs of a certain type (white collar managerial jobs), which no country's population is capable of fulfilling. This is not a reflection of SG people's ability, no country by itself will be able to fill the requirements of the jobs market SG creates.

The problem is that the jobs for people not wanting to be in the rat race or who are less able (the bottom 50%) do not have access to reasonably paying jobs that other rich countries have. 

If you guys try to force MNCs or big companies to hire the bottom 50-60%, they will simply stop coming here.

I don’t have a solution, but I don’t think the government continuing to point to their own numbers helps any.",to add on there was a study showing that median income had improved by  in the last ten years but at the same time the sentiment on the ground is that housing for new couples is more and more expensive both can be true  because the median income may not capture beginning salaries   it s starting to feel like both parties are talking past each other the critics are saying  this is my personal experience and what i am seeing on the ground  though i cannot be certain if it is representative of what is really happening in singapore or just confined to that particular industry likewise the government seems to be focusing on very general statements likely because that s what they have the data on which again may be more applicable to some groups of people than others   it can be true as a whole that singapore needs a constant influx of foreign workers to replace our declining birth rate which will get even more serious in the future and at the same time there are people who may have been replaced by cheaper foreigners or felt that they may have been passed over for a job promotion because of them leading to resentment   it s hard to feel happy that gdp is improving when you yourself are having problems making ends meet when you are having to squeeze into overcrowded trains which themselves are also prone to delays or breaking down from time to time when your bto is delayed for a year or more and i think the pandemic has also further fanned the flames of resentment in part due to increase in retrenchment and just made people feel more frustrated and disgruntled overall   i don t have a solution but i don t think the government continuing to point to their own numbers helps any,add study showing median income improved last ten years time sentiment ground housing new couples expensive true median income may capture beginning salaries starting feel like parties talking past critics saying personal experience seeing ground though cannot certain representative really happening singapore confined particular industry likewise government seems focusing general statements likely data may applicable groups people others true whole singapore needs constant influx foreign workers replace declining birth rate get even serious future time people may replaced cheaper foreigners felt may passed job promotion leading resentment hard feel happy gdp improving problems making ends meet squeeze overcrowded trains also prone delays breaking time time bto delayed year think pandemic also fanned flames resentment part due increase retrenchment made people feel frustrated disgruntled overall solution think government continuing point numbers helps,add study showing median income improved last ten years time sentiment ground housing new couples expensive true median income may capture beginning salaries starting feel like parties talking past critics saying personal experience seeing ground though cannot certain representative really happening singapore confined particular industry likewise government seems focusing general statements likely data may applicable groups people others true whole singapore needs constant influx s replace declining birth rate get even serious future time people may replaced cheaper foreigners felt may passed job promotion leading resentment hard feel happy gdp improving problems making ends meet squeeze overcrowded trains also prone delays breaking time time bto delayed year think pandemic also fanned flames resentment part due increase retrenchment made people feel frustrated disgruntled overall solution think government continuing point numbers helps

The rich and upper middle class whom I **specifically** said were the disproportionate beneficiaries of globalization.

Let me clarify something here: I happen to be a huge beneficiary of globalization, and I naturally am all for it. I happen to be in a globalized industry with very cosmopolitan employees. But this discussion is about how people in Singapore perceive this, and most of them are not rich or upper middle-class.

If you are in the top 8% who happen to buy condos, 90% of the time (I recognize that some old-money industries are not affected) you should not be complaining about globalization because you are the grand winners of globalization. I have this conversation with very conservative colleagues all the time and it blows my mind how stupid it is to hear an American foreign worker (I refuse to use the term expatriate) advocating against globalization when he owes his job to it.

But if you don't happen to be in that category (the other 92%), things get a lot more murky. If you happen to be a technician rather than an engineer, you will be acutely aware that the availability of workers as skilled as you are from other Southeast Asian countries exerts downward pressure on your salary. You'd naturally be wondering if things would be a lot better if the government had more restrictive policies on foreign employment.

In this case, the industry most affected is IT. If you were an IT worker, you'd be wondering how demand for your skills would be affected without so much globalization. Let's be honest here: every large company needs an IT guy, and it's pretty obvious that with less globalization the number of companies wouldn't shrink as much as the pool of Indian IT professionals, who are *legion*.

If you ask \*me\* I would of course say I am very pleased that I can hire cheap IT workers to assist my department.

Just because you see more dark people in CBP does not mean that Singaporeans are losing out economically. You can have high numbers of foreigners in Singapore and yet have low citizen unemployment rate and rising wages as the data shows. 

This is the perfect embodiment of an ""us vs them"" or should I say afraid of losing out / afraid of dying shallow thinking that we need to look beyond. It can be a mutually beneficial economic relationship.


If you go to UAE, every 9 persons out of 10 will be a foreigner and 1 Emirati. It does not mean the Emirati is suffering due to the influx of dark skinned people.

Just because you see more dark people in CBP does not mean that Singaporeans are losing out economically. You can have high numbers of foreigners in Singapore and yet have low citizen unemployment rate and rising wages as the data shows.

Is it truly accurate data, though? Wouldn't you agree that the data could be skewed because of things like Grab/Foodpanda, or even the SGUnited traineeships or even the apprenticeship courses? What is the data methodology behind the numbers?

>This is the perfect embodiment of an ""us vs them"" or should I say kiasu / kiasu shallow thinking that we need to look beyond. It can be a mutually beneficial economic relationship.

Now that's putting words in my mouth. I simply said the data doesn't match what people see on the ground. I never said the foreigner vs local is a bad thing either. Why? Because it doesn't affect me tangibly. Even the ""mutual benefit"" thing you mentioned, I have no clue.

This is a massive perception problem that rears its ugly head during every major crisis as people start getting retrenched or lose their incomes. 

During the Asian economic crisis years, it was the Hong Kongers offered an easy path to PR in Singapore who were targetted and blamed for property cost rises. 

During GFC 2009 and a couple of years after, there was a big rise anti-foreigner sentiment accompanied by opposition to the population white paper. 

During Covid, we see the same situation repeat this time primarily against Indians despite CECA being in place for literally 15+ years.

An analogy is that I think of it like a test - there's a score out of 100.

The question is what is a passing score (or conversely, what is a failure score)? What are the metrics we should measure it by? How do we add scores or deduct scores? 

0 Covid cases? 0 death cases (and do you measure it as a percentage of the population)? 0 interruption to business? Access to vaccines? Citizen sentiment? 

You can list all these factors and come to an overall score. And that overall score is going to vary depending on priorities / definitions. For example, [Bloomberg's score focuses on business reopening](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ob9hlx/singapore_drops_to_13_in_updated_bloomberg_covid/h3mubya/). NZ's way is to go for 0 Covid, and Australia has snap lockdowns. 

When your initial comment talks about ""obfuscate their failures"", my response is therefore that it depends on the definition of failure.

Going back to my analogy of the score out of 100, your examples go towards deducting the score (I'm not arguing here whether your examples count as failures). The question is then: (a) how much does it deduct the score? (e.g. does it deduct by 1 point? 5 points? 10 points?) (b) after all the deductions, do we still get a passing mark (say, is it still 75/100? 51/100? 30/100?).

I say this because I feel that there's a narrative in r/singapore that the Singapore government has only a 30/100 (or failing) mark - which is why we get you say that there's been ""failures in other areas like response to Covid"". 

Your examples above point to singular issues which you then agglomerate into a ""general lack of proactive measures"", but to me, it doesn't answer the question of whether there is an overall failure.

Note: this also doesn't talk about the question of comparison with other countries.

I think that until this question of what ""failure"" means is worked out, there's no point having a discussion (in general, not with you in specific). What each side will do is bring up examples like ""look we let in so many Indians"" (or in more PC terms) or ""look at our vaccination rates! Procuring so many vaccines doesn't happen in a vacuum or without proactive steps"" - without going into the heart of the matter, which is ""how do we define failure""?",,4,1625645655,2021-07-07 08:14:15,"Hmm that's not really my point.

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",justastatistic,"> Now that's putting words in my mouth. I simply said the data doesn't match what people see on the ground. I never said the foreigner vs local is a bad thing either. Why? Because it doesn't affect me tangibly. Even the ""mutual benefit"" thing you mentioned, I have no clue.

People on the ground can be horrendously wrong in their perception vs the actual facts or reality and this is proven across the world in various surveys. 

>1. Happiness: we think our fellow Singaporeans are much more miserable than surveys of happiness show. We guess that only 47% of Singaporeans would say they are very or rather happy, when actually 93% say they are in a recent representative survey.
2. Wealth of the bottom 70%: we asked people to guess what proportion of total wealth the least wealthy 70% in Singapore owned – our guess would seem reasonable at 37% but this majority of the population actually own only 19% of wealth in Singapore.
3. Home-owners: By ‘owned’, we mean owning the home outright or buying it with the help of
a mortgage or other loan. As much as we recognise the high cost of property in Singapore,
91% of Singaporeans are actually home-owners. Our guess was that only 68% of
Singaporeans own their homes.
4. Health spending: we think we spend four times as much as we actually do on our health. We
think we spend 21% of our total GDP on health expenditure when in fact we only spend 5%.
If our guess was right, this would be the equivalent of an extra SGD 65bn spending on health.
5. Trump: Fieldwork for the survey was conducted the month before the presidential election in
the US – so we asked who people thought would win. And like the vast majority of countries
– along with nearly all pundits – we were wrong: 67% thought Clinton would win and only
14% saw the Trump victory coming.

>Good health: In Singapore we think other people report their health as worse than they actually are, and in fact, we are among the least accurate in our beliefs. Our average guess is that only 55% of people say their health is good or very good, when actually 81% say their health is good or very good. The Asia Pacific region average guess is 55% for people saying their health is good or very good, while 9% guessed their health was poor.

>Foreign-born prisoners: We think that immigrants make up a much greater proportion of the Singapore prison population than they actually do. We guessed an average of 30% of all prisoners share of the overall population at about 30%. In Asia Pacific, the average guess was 22%.

>Murder rate: The large majority of people in Singapore think the murder rate is higher now  or the same as 2000, when it is actually around 78% lower. About 3 in 10 (34%) think that it's higher, 31% think it's about the same, and only 28% correctly guess that it is lower. Across the Asia Pacific, 74% think the murder rate is higher or the same.

>Teenage pregnancy: We hugely overestimate the proportion of 15-19 year old women and girls giving birth each year across the Asia Pacific region. Singapore thinks 11% of Singaporean teenage girls give birth each year (about one in ten), when the actual figure is only 0.4%. The Asia Pacific average guess is 21%.

>Diabetes: People in every country significantly overestimate the prevalence of diabetes, including those in Asia Pacific. We think that 35% of people in Singapore have diabetes, when the actual figure is around 11%. The Asia Pacific average guess was 35%.

>Facebook membership: All countries also overestimate Facebook membership, with an average guess that 83% of Singapore aged 13+ have a Facebook account, when the actual figure is 67%. The Asia Pacific average guess was 71%.

>Vehicles: Most countries overestimate the number of registered vehicles per 100 people with the Asia Pacific average guess being 84%. Singapore estimated the number of registered vehicles per 100 people at 53 (approximately 1 vehicle for every 2 persons) when the actual number is just 18 (approximately 1 vehicle for every 5 persons).

>Suicide: There is a real split in accuracy on the proportion of deaths by suicide among young people. Singapore estimated the proportion of deaths of women aged 15-24 due to suicide was 18% when the actual figure was 34%. Estimates for the deaths of young men due to suicide was 18% when the actual number was 27%.

>Vaccines: There are a wide variety of views among Asia Pacific countries when it comes to beliefs around the link between some vaccines and autism in healthy children despite the claim being widely discredited. In Singapore 20% believe the statement to be true and 48% say they don't know, with 32% saying it is false. Across the Asia Pacific region, 22% said the claim was true while 36% said it was false.

>Terrorism: Most countries in the Asia Pacific do not believe deaths from terrorist attacks are lower in the recent years, despite that being the case in many. In Singapore, 22% say that deaths from terrorist attacks were lower between 2002 and 2016 than they were between 1985 and 2000, a further 40% said about the same, while 24% think deaths from terrorism were higher over the last 15 years. In reality, deaths from terrorist attacks dropped from 5 to 0 over that time period. In the Asia Pacific region as a whole, one third (33%) believed there were more terror related deaths, 35% said about the same and 19% said there were less deaths.

>Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam have both referred to PWM as “minimum wage plus”, a point which union leaders echoed.

**Edited to add this**: [Here](https://youtu.be/jbqdqevYUXA) is a clip of SM Tharman speaking about the PWM in Parliament, at about 40 secs into the video, he says:

>I would not - and I say this to *everyone* *from all sides* (here he gestures in the general direction of MP Gan Siow Huang, who had just stood up to rebut MP Jamus Lim) - I would not exaggerate the differences between the PWM model and the minimum wage model. The PWM model is a minimum wage plus and it is a sectoral approach.

And researchers from LKY SPP agree with this analysis saying [here](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/what-is-the-progressive-wage-model-and-is-it-better-than-a-minimum-wage) that:

>\[T\]he most significant difference is the PWM's wage ladder. It is effectively a sectoral minimum wage, set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government, union and other industry representatives. In addition to setting a minimum wage, they also set wage rungs, giving workers a way to seek out a pay increase by improving their skills.  
>  
>""In a sense, the PWM is really a sectoral minimum wage. But it could also be considered a minimum wage plus, because it specifies an income and skills ladder that goes beyond the flat minimum,"" said Professor Ho.

The PWM is a negotiated understanding under the tripartite framework — i.e. government, labour unions, and businesses. There will invariably be all sorts of friction on the part of different stakeholders, as you’ve rightly alluded to.

My point is that if they just recognised and conceded that they‘ve implemented *a form of minimum wage*, we could’ve moved past that silly debate and think about what *else* can be done to improve PWM right at the outset.

And it is not that they did not have enough Ministers in cabinet with the ability to explain to people the details and the merits of the PWM or FTAs. Its a general patronising (paternalistic in you words) attitude that PAP has, even after 2011. They likely believe that GE2011 results was a fluke, and that they can capture the swing and GRC back. GE2015 results, being a unique election after LKY's death, swung back in PAP's favour, and they doubled down with the AHTC matter and paternalistic/patronising way of brushing citizen's concerns away. There somehow seems to be early signs of reconciliation within the PAP rank, that the GE2011 results was more than a fluke, after GE2020 results came out. Its bad enough that there are 12 Opposition members. It is worst that 2 GRCs were very very close (<3500 votes) to being lost with 4 more Ministers losing. So hopefully OYK will continue more of the Tharman/Lawrence Wong style than Shanmugam/CCS style. 



Even now, I dnt think they have explained the CECA in a way that ppl will see the inherent benefit esp to those from 20-40th percentile of income earners. Singapore, besides Indonesia, is the only ASEAN country to be in the top 10 Importer country list of India. While Indonesia exports lots of Palm Oil and Raw Material to India, Singapore exports Electronics and Petrochemical products (eg. PP/PE resins). The fact that Singapore is the only country in ASEAN to have a FTA agreement with India, means 1) We are able to attract and retain investors in the Manufacturing Sector, as the cost of exporting would be relatively cheaper from SG to India than from emerging economies like Thailand/Vietnam/Indonesia. And we do this by letting low-tech low-wage manufacturing processes to move into Thailand/Vietnam, and retain high-tech high-wage manufacturing processes like Assembly and Testing in Singapore. 2) We get a headstart in 2005, when no one else in ASEAN was looking at India. This is similar to how Singapore invested in Electronics sector in the 70s way ahead of any other country in ASEAN. 

Somehow, the CECA debate is a very convenient smoke screen for not only the nativist/racist arguementators but also the PAP, that is happy that the attention is diverted from other pertinent issues like unfair employment, cost of living, income inequality, etc. Hence why, I'd rather the data needed to address the issues brought out by those bent on lynching CECA, be out quickly, so that we can move on to questions on housing, cost of living, employment practices and so on.",,1,1625804997,2021-07-09 04:29:57,"1 leaves another one will come, sg has built the country to have good infra, no corruption and etc..if companies think leaving Singapore to another country to cut cost then by all means leave.

Grab and foodpanda workers have seen almost 20-30% decline in revenue so I think it's fair to say the data isn't really skewed by that if the median did not decrease.",if you were looking at mean wages then yes but op was looking at median income which is not affected by extremes that being said i agree that singapore is suffering from an increased wealth inequality but you cannot deny that our as a whole wages are going up as well if foodpandagrab is as negative of an impact as you imply the median will be pulled down as more people with lower wages will be in the lower  percentile grab and foodpanda workers have seen almost  decline in revenue so i think it is fair to say the data is not really skewed by that if the median did not decrease,looking mean wages yes op looking median income affected extremes said agree singapore suffering increased wealth inequality cannot deny whole wages going well foodpandagrab negative impact imply median pulled people lower wages lower percentile grab foodpanda workers seen almost decline revenue think fair say data really skewed median decrease,looking mean wages yes op looking median income affected extremes said agree singapore suffering increased wealth inequality cannot deny whole wages going well foodpandagrab negative impact imply median pulled people lower wages lower percentile grab foodpanda workers seen almost decline revenue think fair say data really skewed median decrease

I think you can detect that tone when one reads LKY’s memoirs. They’re in themselves very enlightening and insightful, but one can’t help but note that the tone of condescension in some parts hurts rather than helps the government’s image, especially when these words of wisdom and advice are preserved for posterity. But perhaps it also helps to mark the tone adopted at the time for historical purposes.

The question today is whether it still works or can work. I really don’t think so. Like you said, today’s electorate are much better educated on issues concerning foreign policy, economics, social policy, etc. And this applies not just to local policies, but also policies adopted by other countries to address problems in their lands.

We have enough ppl who can interpretate.

You're right, its not about this. **I also do think we should have more data that is released.**

I work with data daily, and I'm fully aware of the constraints I have. I will say though that there is already a lot of data that has been released to work with; there is a lot available on singstat. I also disagree that there aren't a lot of papers published on our local scene. There's quite plenty lol

And, as someone who is on a team doing a research piece now as well, you often don't need specific datasets they are choosing to not release. Even if you release more data, doesn't mean suddenly there'll be more pieces or papers on it what.

But I digress. Whether or not we should have more transparency is not relevant to my point. My main point is agreeing with the person before me, in that people who don't know how to interpret the data, which is the demographic I'm referring to, not academics or whatnot, or even worse, people who know how to interpret statistics who **deliberately use statistics to fit their own narrative** (Jamus Lim's parliamentary speech on the rule of law during the Parti Liyani uproar was particularly guilty of this), is worrying.

And if you really want to understand how statistics play into rl, imo, you need to walk the ground, volunteer, listen to people's stories, and not just complain on social media or forward chain messages on Whatsapp. Which I would say quite a significant portion of people just do not do!

Imo, what we are lacking is not data. It is a renewed sense of community, FROM community. Without that, I don't think it matters if we have data or no data. Because without that, we immediately assume whatever information we have, fits into our narrative, instead of thinking of how it fits into the story of other people.",,2,1625654848,2021-07-07 10:47:28,"You're right, its not about this. **I also do think we should have more data that is released.**

I work with data daily, and I'm fully aware of the constraints I have. I will say though that there is already a lot of data that has been released to work with; there is a lot available on singstat. I also disagree that there aren't a lot of papers published on our local scene. There's quite plenty laugh out loud

And, as someone who is on a team doing a research piece now as well, you often don't need specific datasets they are choosing to not release. Even if you release more data, doesn't mean suddenly there'll be more pieces or papers on it what.

But I digress. Whether or not we should have more transparency is not relevant to my point.

"PSP’s foreign talent policy proposals will hurt S’pore’s competitiveness, drive costs up: SMEs, economists",redwithin,"From the perspective of someone in the midst of the hiring process right now for my company, I think it's quite clear that foreigners either do jobs that Singaporeans don't want to do, or that there aren't enough Singaporeans to do. A big part of the problem is simply that there's a mismatch between available jobs and the skills required.

We're a tech company, and basically, no Singaporean even wants to apply for our tech-related jobs (e.g. developers). On the other hand, for jobs like operations and sales, you're busy filtering through applications because many people are trying their luck (and many of them aren't holding down roles now). The less tech-literate you are, the smaller the pool of jobs that are available to you. On the other hand, if you chose the right degree, you're made for life.  


Raising the EP minimum salary (e.g) is not going to help the vast majority of those looking for jobs at all.

i'm not a policymaker.

at the individual level, i think this quote is quite relevant: ""When you complain you make yourself a victim. Leave the situation, change the situation or accept it. All else is madness.""

so if an individual doesn't like the way the market works, either change the way a market economy functions, accept that that's how it functions, or leave the market economy.

it's like children asking ""why do i have to learn calculus? i'm never going to use it blah blah"". well that's the game, you just gotta play the game. of course there are also cognitive benefits to learning calculus that cannot be directly quantified, and there are also direct benefits if you ever decide to do anything that requires mathematical understanding. but for the most of us, it's just part of the game, we play it.

*but i do think the Singapore govt needs to make it clearer to people who didn't get to go to university on the first try that there are alternative pathways to higher education. Should also invest vastly more in education. Just to get a general boost of education for everyone. At the very least even if the degree becomes commonplace in Singapore, at least the Singaporean has had more years of education/is more educated, and has a qualification that can be recognised overseas as a degree. Of course, this is not relevant for people already some distance into their career, such people will probably be more in tune with their priorities in life and can decide how they want to proceed - if they want to upskill/reskill govt support is always there (so many bootcamps these days).

"PSP’s foreign talent policy proposals will hurt S’pore’s competitiveness, drive costs up: SMEs, economists",SherbetLimau,"I would partially disagree. The issue is not solely about ""entitled Singaporeans"". The issue is also linked to the median salary and the cost/standard of living.

For example, $2500 for an entry level job of a Software Engineer in Singapore is considered quite low (given that the median Singapore income is $4800). Most university educated Singaporeans would reject such a job. But this would be same in my home country as well (if I offered about 50% of the median salary for an entry level software engineer position, most applicants would reject it).

A major reason why many foreigners are working in Singapore is because the salary in Singapore goes a longer way in their home country. This is not the same for Singaporeans.

Beyond a point, organization will simply ship the jobs out or cease operation; but won't be able to sustain and hire locally - be it because of a price point that won't work, or be it because of supply side shortages.
