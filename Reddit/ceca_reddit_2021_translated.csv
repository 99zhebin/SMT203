A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,FutureSecret5503,"You obviously has a lack of understanding of CECA vs the other FTAs. 

Only the CECA has the clause on mutual recognition of standards in 4-5 major sectors of the economy to facilitate entry of Indian nationals in these sectors into S’pore.

In addition, only the CECA and 2 other FTAs have the cause on freedom of movement of persons in 127 professions. The only diff is that nationals of the other 2 FTA countries have not flooded our island unlike India which has seen a 500% increase in EP holders since 2010.

And finally, the CECA’s clause on ICTs is very generous compared with other FTAs. While other FTAs have maximum length of 5 years for their nationals to stay here, the CECA allows Indians to stay here for up to 8 years.

How else do you explain the flood of Indian nationals into our island to the extent that at one point, our cinemas were showing so many Hindi movies - even more than Chinese and no Malay movies?  How else do you explain that there are more Indian international schools here than any other international schools?",1,1631716295,2021-09-15 14:31:35,"You obviously has a lack of understanding of CECA vs the other FTAs.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,TakingPrivateALevels,">more Indian-Singaporeans were on the receiving end of these racist attacks rather than Indian expats

This is the real problem. Back when hostility against China Chinese was widespread in Singapore, this did not lead to an increase in racism against Chinese Singaporeans. The two groups were easy to tell apart (different appearance and accents) and ethnic Chinese are the majority in Singapore. We usually referred to China Chinese as ""PRCs"", never ""Chinese"".

Contrast how Singaporeans refer to India Indians as simply ""Indians"" which could also refer to Indian Singaporeans. The two groups are not as easy to distinguish by appearance and accent; in fact, some Chinese Singaporeans have the misconception that Tamil = Singaporean and North Indian = foreigner.

My company once worked with an IT vendor whose team was mainly India Indians. Dealing with them was very frustrating and they completely failed to deliver on their promises (eventually we had to cancel the project). During and after the project, I noticed an increase in (not ethnic Indian) colleagues making racist remarks, not only against the vendor, but also against Indian Singaporean colleagues.",1,1631763600,2021-09-16 03:40:00,"

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,Boring_Landscape,"""The second reason for the higher concentration of Indians in higher-paying jobs is because of the growth of the IT and tech sector across the world, hence, the need for more IT professionals. Indians generally make up the bulk of the IT jobs not because our education is superior but simply because the system produces so many people with the required skill set. The fact that there are so many trained professionals in India who can speak English and also work for a relatively lower salary is the primary reason for recruitment for India. Again this is not because the Indian education system is better than Singapore or any other country's education system, it's simply that we have more people to meet the demand and as a result of an abundant supply of professionals, there is higher competition for these jobs. You see more Indians because of our larger population and abundance of trained professionals. If you're wondering why there aren't as many Chinese as Indians it's simply because we have an English advantage, a remnant of being the jewel in the crown of the British Empire for 200 years.""  


Type so much just to validate that Indians have more 'Professionals' for IT job?. and 2ndly comparing about chinese and indians because Indians english is better because they have been colonized.

Singapore education is better and we provide English lesson more competitve than in India. Your country being colonized doesn't mean your english is better than us. It's subjective to each person whether they are willing to learn it or not. and tbh English is not the primary reason needed to work in IT.  Don't have to brag about english, IT is very systematic and more to problem-solving.   


"" Indians generally make up the bulk of the IT jobs not because our education is superior but simply because the system produces so many people with the required skill set. ""  


Don't kid yourself. Indians can get fake certification till they make it into the job. What kind of bullshit professionalism are you bragging about?. Singapore hire lecturers for thousand of dollars who are really expert in their field and provide from basic to advance knowledge with business samples, but yes I can admit our education system may be slow at times as IT fastly evolved..

There are other locals who are suitable to replace your role, yet they couldn't get it because of the underhanded system implemented.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,Thaithrowaway1985,"This post is good, but the main points in it, in my personal opinion, has been repeated over and over again in mainstream media, and there are no good solutions to the 2 main issues:

1) retrenched local Singaporean professionals stuck in low-paying odd jobs with no future prospects. The government has no good solution to this and the retrenched local professionals are not likely to keep quiet and accept their fate. Problem is, in my petsonal opinion, it seems many people, including the government and many expats, seem to want these locals to keep quiet and accept their fate

2) in my personal opinion, one thing unnoticed and ignored is r/sg is that actually, the government knows very well that Singapore (note that I say Singapore, not Singaporeans) indeed do need foreigners to survive. This is something I agree with, that Singapore need foreigners to survive. But what is ignored is that while the authorities are very comfortable with increased foreign presence in Singapore's economy, it is not comfortable when vast segments of any industry/sector are dependent on foreign expats from just a few countries. What it wants is a heavily diversified international workforce. The companies and employers that have trouble having their work passes approved are the one that keep recruiting from the same nationality pool. On the other hand, companies that actively make efforts to recruit widely from several different countries rather than a few countries have an easier time. The recent outcry from companies whom complain about increasing work pass restrictions are the ones that still cannot diversify beyond the same recruitment pool

1) retrenched local Singaporean professionals stuck in low-paying odd jobs with no future prospects. The government has no good solution to this and the retrenched local professionals are not likely to keep quiet and accept their fate. Problem is, in my petsonal opinion, it seems many people, including the government and many expats, seem to want these locals to keep quiet and accept their fate

2) in my personal opinion, one thing unnoticed and ignored is r/sg is that actually, the government knows very well that Singapore (note that I say Singapore, not Singaporeans) indeed do need foreigners to survive. This is something I agree with, that Singapore need foreigners to survive. But what is ignored is that while the authorities are very comfortable with increased foreign presence in Singapore's economy, it is not comfortable when vast segments of any industry/sector are dependent on foreign expats from just a few countries. What it wants is a heavily diversified international workforce. The companies and employers that have trouble having their work passes approved are the one that keep recruiting from the same nationality pool. On the other hand, companies that actively make efforts to recruit widely from several different countries rather than a few countries have an easier time. The recent outcry from companies whom complain about increasing work pass restrictions are the ones that still cannot diversify beyond the same recruitment pool

In addition, despite the recent complains over the last 11 years, in absolute numbers, the number of E-Pass and S-Pass and PR granted has increased, even though the ""rate of increase"" has dropped. It is not that less foreigners are granted E-Pass, S-Pass or PR but the raw number of applicants have increased, due to the recent political situation in Malaysia and Hong Kong, and foreign talented migrants are fleeing from those areas, coming into Singapore, usually more skilled and more investment dollars, and there are only so many slots open for foreign talent.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,vanguy79,"Like many Singaporeans, we are sorry that we made you and other Indians feel discriminated against. Yes the points you made are very valid and thanks for pointing out the hypocrisy. 

This is what my observation is. Is there a racial undertone for this target against CECA? Yes there is. Many Singaporeans are racists. Unlike Other countries we don’t say it out loud usually or we don’t refuse service. But there are racists. 

But it so happens so many factors combine to make this a target. First, our dear government steamrolls the citizens opinions by ignoring our feedback and make policies regardless. 

Second, this pandemic causes many working Singaporeans to lose their jobs or lose their opportunity for advancement which causes many Singaporeans to feel aggrieved. 

Thirdly, it sure doesn’t help that there are many anecdotal evidence companies are hiring more of a certain nationality than locals. Too many to ignore the stories. This is true of western owned companies too by the way. There was a recent report last year of a British Aerospace engineering firm that made the news of a hiring imbalance. 

Let’s put it this way. Until recently as I understand, India is very strict about foreign direct investment that restrict foreign companies to own their Indian office unless there is a joint venture with local companies. This ensures local Indian companies has a say and direct influence over manpower. 
Singapore has no such restriction as far as I understand. Apart from local manpower laws that requires a certain percentage of local hires but it does not care if local hires are only hired to do admin work or menial work. As such locals does not have any way to influence hiring decisions in MNCs or foreign companies that set up businesses here compared to India.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,hikari8807,"On the point as to why is CECA singled out amongst the 26 FTAs.

It wasn't Singaporeans who first had the idea that CECA made Singapore obligated free movement of indians to Singapore. It is the indian government who planted the idea by threatening to take Singapore Government to court for not upholding their [Obligation] to CEC Agreement.

On the second point, which you claimed that Singaporeans had issue because it is indian, and no one would complaint it had been Chinese or Caucasian majority. First of all, this statement is racist as hell. Back in early 2000s, when Singapore experienced an influx of PRCs, Singaporeans complaint about it too. You can find that reference in the same parliamentary session you refer to. This has nothing to do with race. It is about protecting the welfare, rights and benefit of locals.

Many foreigners came to Singapore with little regards to the local culture, way of life and respect for the people here. Some expat seems to have a sense of moral and status superiority over the locals. 

https://mothership.sg/2019/10/deepavali-angry-condominium-security-guard/

I hope I don't come across being racist, but despite the caste system was abolish in India decades ago, many indians continue to emit differential treatment to people based on their skin colour. My Singaporean indian friend share with me he had very negative experience with indians coming from india, especially those from a much northern parts of india.

The presentation of the sentiment today is not a simple cause of racism or a deliberate manipulation of a single politicians to go against an entire group of people. It is a systemic issue that has compounded over the years. It would be wrong to point fingers at Singaporeans put labels to their expression. Indian government and media itself contributed to the misinformation and fueling of emotions.

please remember just 150 years before , Europeans. considered Chinese people as innately less intelligent , less enterprising and less moralistic because of biological traits. 

These cultural comments that Indians are this & that are just trying to be scientific and statistically right instead of being racist based on biological traits..If you apply the same lens to others then you will see that these traits are uniform everywhere  
All these racist veiled as culturalists, confuse local supremacy doesn't mean objective supremacy. please note that Indians do much better than Chinese and definitely than Singaporeans as CEOs of large MNCs like google, microsoft and in countries like UK they are 40% of the top 15 richest...Even India will be 10+ trillion economy in a couple of decades"

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,FamiliarSource98,"I'm an Indian PR, been living here since young (probably 3 or 4)  as far as I can tell, attended local schools (from pri all the way up to poly), although I had little or no friends during lower primary, that slowly changed when I reached pri 4/5 I made friends with other races including Malays and Chinese too and I don't treat them any different nor do they. Had the best experiences/fun and am very happy my closest friends today are local Chinese and Malays, as a matter of fact, I'm serving my National Service at the moment and am very happy and proud to do so alongside my Singaporean counterparts and overall I absolutely love this country very much and it's the closest country to being a ""perfect"" country, politics aside. 

After reading through some of the replies here, I can see why the comments about how some individuals can be obnoxious, I agree too. I feel as an Indian, it is taught to us to be competitive since young and the mindset has always been there to compare ourselves with each other. I think it's a whole cultural thing that has propagated into some people having massive egos and looking down on others once they're successful, this behaviour is something that I do not condone and find absolutely disgusting, though that is changing.

That being said, I do hope people realise these loud obnoxious pricks do NOT represent us, and I myself am pretty disgusted by such people. At the end of the day, I guess you should be grounded and grateful especially if you're given an opportunity to work in a first world country and efforts should be made to assimilate and integrate and  into the local community.

While all we hear are about the loud and bad apples, there are many people who aren't like that and not everyone is as such. I won't talk much about the ceca thing but I would also say on the other hand it's quite hurting to read some pretty harsh remarks/stereotypes and generalisations made at the race/country in general just because of a few bunch of idiots.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,ShadeX8,"First of all, you are very welcomed here in Singapore, and please don't put some of the comments you might have seen to mind. Always remember that online discourse is always going to be a minority portion of the population.

There is a point you've made that kind of resonated with me, in explaining why Indians are the punching bag in the conversation right now. The point being that low end jobs had historically been dominated by Indian workers, and that might have seeped into our social conscience. With the increasing visibility of highly paid Indian workers, it does make me wonder if some class discrimination is at play with the hostility. It's not going to be a conscious thing, but rather, a subconscious idea that Indian workers were supposed to be low-paid, and that a change in that status discomforts some of these loud dissenters. 

My personal thought on this is that there is some hangover displeasure from the White Paper era, where immigration was considered pretty lax and EP/S-passes were quite readily available too. Even though from then on, there were quite visible steps towards tightening that flow, some of the locals still have that impression of easy access and unlimited influx of foreign labor. 

Globalization is also definitely a part of the problem, and in fact, a lot of this discourse is being replicated in many developed countries in their own forms and conflicts. Think a lot of the 'racism' is actually just a fear of the unknown, and fear of being displaced in their place of birth/comfort. 

Haven't seen any developed country solve this societal issue yet, so it's still up in the air as to whether Singapore will ever pull through this. Hopefully we can find a middle ground somewhere, and it does bear to mind that everyone is just looking to survive and earn a living. Don't hate on the people, even if you have issues with the immigration policies.",1,1631712747,2021-09-15 13:32:27,"First of all, you are very welcomed here in Singapore, and please don't put some of the comments you might have seen to mind.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,jowkeng,"I think we all should also tilt the spotlight back to the government and government policy. Enough ink has been spilled between different groups of people.

Singapore's immigration policy is really the lack of one. We bring in foreigners ""purely"" for the pragmatic reason of growing our economy without a view to assimilating into a citizen. It is not that hard to get an S-pass or EP but good luck getting a Citizenship to sink roots here unless you are James Dyson.

Worse, we seem to have a view towards ""setting aside"" different groups of industry /function for different nationalities. Ostensibly because different nationalities ""specialize"" in different areas. Indians in IT, Pinoy's in healthcare, Malaysians in blue collar and middle-back office (I stereotype here but pls bear with it).

Why should we be surprised if different nationalities end up cornering various parts of the economy?

Does it sound familiar? Well that was a big part of our Colonial history under the British - Divide and Rule. As a Singaporean Chinese I am aware that generations ago us Sporean Chinese did not have a collective identity but had deep stereotypes and cast aspersions about each other, (See Hokkien - Teochew riots). The colonial rulers ""brought in"" different groups of people for various purposes to suit their colonial enterprise, without ever  a long-term view to letting them settle permanently. To the effect that the different dialect groups ""owned"" different economic functions (ask your great-grandparents). 

There was also a hard fought struggle post WW2 during decolonization to obtain citizenship rights for everybody whom the British ""brought in"", while balancing the concerns and sensitivities of the native Bumis which pretty much had been left in poverty by the British.

An even harder struggle was to build a unique post-independence identity that could encompass everybody the British brought in as well as people who've been here since long ago. Given that the forces of Globalization have been unleashed perhaps we've lost some of that and need to rebuilt.

Undeniably, the British also used ""Divide and Rule"" to great effect in India, for better or for worse. Makes you wonder if the colonial policy DNA is still present today.

In my view unless we adopt a more ""pathway to citizenship"" immigration policy like what Canada, New Zealand, Australia does, local - foreigner divide will also be present in our society. The ""Us vs Them"" mentality in both locals and foreigners minds cannot be broken. This of course needs to be held in place by a stronger social safety net funded by all taxpayers so everyone has a stronger sense of social solidarity.

The government and how our government policies have been designed needs to shoulder alot of responsibility for how this has panned out. But this is a whole topic unto itself.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,deheuty,"By probability alone, Singapore, or any country in the world **cannot** compete with the global job market in terms of getting the best person for the job.

I think basically, a government of each country has to balance two objectives for their own country: how do they balance between economic growth obtained via open borders (i.e., allowing the best person from ANY country to apply for jobs in the country) versus preserving threats to nationality/national identity/nationalism etc?

I think the balance of these two priorities lies at the crux of this issue. Are we building a money making enterprise or are we building a nation? Is a nation just another money making enterprise or is money making a means to build a nation? Which is our priority? I think discussing how policies that can strike a balance between these two goals would be more constructive.

Presently, I think while the Singapore govt prioritises GDP **as** nation building, Singaporeans see it as a **means** to nation building and if it threatens our national identity (e.g., Singapore for Singaporeans) then the GDP making policies should be tweaked.

Hindi movies were screened in Singapore before the country became independent from the British Empire. They were called Hindustani movies back then, and Malays and Sikhs were the main clientele. Just ask your Malay friends about Raj Kapoor or Shammi Kapoor. They confirm chop will know one.

The ignorance and tunnel vision of some ethnocentrists on this sub knows no bounds. Just because you don't do ABC or watch XYZ doesn't mean it's an imported trend. Singapore =/= China.

> The only diff is that nationals of the other 2 FTA countries have not flooded our island unlike India which has seen a 500% increase in EP holders since 2010.

Again, I mentioned that CECA did not apply to migrant workers so I was not saying that there are construction jobs open that locals can take. What point I was trying to make was that locals have no problem with foreigners doing tasks in sectors where they don't have manpower/desire to do such as construction etc. but they are especially mindful of foreigners, especially Indians, taking the PMETs. I was trying to highlight the racial aspect of this issue.  
Think about it. You grow up seeing South Asians doing menial work. Whether you want to or not you end up having this prejudice ""South Asians are fit only for construction"" and then you grow up and see South Asians, more specifically Indians, take over a lucrative field. You begin to question, ""How can these people do better than me?"". The same would not apply for Chinese or Caucasians because the Chinese are similar to the vast majority such that they may be able to pass off as Singaporean.  
That is the point that Im trying to make, this whole PMET thing is a problem because the jobs are going to Indians.

It's subjective to each person whether they are willing to learn it or not. and tbh English is not the primary reason needed to work in IT. Don't have to brag about english, IT is very systematic and more to problem-solving.

See point above. You still need to learn English to communicate with colleagues. You can do the job well but cant communicate that just messes up the system.

>Indians can get fake certification till they make it into the job. What kind of bullshit professionalism are you bragging about?. Singapore hire lecturers for thousand of dollars who are really expert in their field and provide from basic to advance knowledge with business samples, but yes I can admit our education system may be slow at times as IT fastly evolved..

>While I know lower-wage workers do not get EPs and nor are their occupations relevant to CECA I just want to highlight this observation. This is partly the reason why I think there is a racial element to the whole CECA issue.

I acknowledge that foreign workers are not included in CECA. The point Im trying to make is that the entire problem is due to the fact that the jobs are going to Indians. Suppose if the jobs went to Singaporean Indians there would still be uproar. But if it went to Chinese or Caucasians no one would bat an eye. 

Why? Think about it. You grow up seeing South Asians doing menial work. Whether you want to or not you end up having this prejudice ""South Asians are fit only for construction"" and then you grow up and see South Asians, more specifically Indians, take over a lucrative field. You begin to question, ""How can these people do better than me?"". 

This is the racial bias Im talking about.",1,1631715700,2021-09-15 14:21:40,"
I was explaining why Indians are preferred over Mainland Chinese. We have English speaking advantage and in no place did I mention our English is better than Singaporean English.


See point above. You still need to learn English to communicate with colleagues. You can do the job well but cant communicate that just messes up the system.


I never say that Indian education is better (explicitly make that clear) nor do I say that we are more professional. And contrary to popular belief majority of Indians dont buy degrees. Only recognised, well known universities are respected abroad. Others dont get foreign jobs just with their degree, they work in India, gain some experience then move to other places. My point with that entire paragraph was the surge in Indians is not due to CECA, its due to globalisation. 

Your comment basically shows you haven't read my post carefully and you're just jumping to conclusions that suit your prejudice. Even after explicitly stating this surge is not due to Indian superiority in any skill, rather its a consequence of globalisation and abundance of supply, you still make the conclusions you want to make."

Fully agreed. This is something many redditors are probably too young to remember. Xenophobia against PRC ladies was very real, in tandem with the influx of PRC nationals in the late 90s early 2000s.

They then believe that all Indians are bad etc. Definitely not saying that that's what you're doing, but I just wanted to say that the first step to addressing that bias is to acknowledge that we have a problem.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Really not a rant against your comment, more towards this whole dumpster fire of a thread. Hope you have a good day ahead!"

Lol..This is just racism masquerading as culturism ...Indians are culturally inferior because of a,b.c traits. It might even sound statistically right because in every community there will be some sample of people exhibiting traits.. Are you sure Chinese Singaporeans don't backstab at work or play politics? Heck no and you are kidding yourselves..Lack of courtesy..My goodness ..The umpteen situation where locals exhibited ""courtesy"" is every where to be seen..

Villager traits -- My god..People of my generation have not forgotten most ads mentioning ""mandarin required "" ..What is that?

By your logic, Europeans considered 100 years before Chinese to be innately less intelligent , less enterprising and less moralistic..Tell me who is right?

""Less arrogant"" and ""self aware"" all these show sense of loss of self esteem...

Note that local superiority doesn't mean objective superiority...Indians do better than Chinese and much better than the cream of Singaporeans who migrate in countries like US, UK and Australia where the discrimination is less...A nadella or pichai are possible there and less doubtful in Singapore. India will also be a 10 trillion economy in a decade or so

Not entirely surprising, since LKY had long seeded the idea among Singaporeans, that the country's economy is sustained by the Chinese and that if the Indians were majority, Singapore would have sunk. So there is a certain chauvanism that is at play too, I would say.

See point above. You still need to learn English to communicate with colleagues. You can do the job well but cant communicate that just messes up the system.

I never say that Indian education is better (explicitly make that clear) nor do I say that we are more professional. And contrary to popular belief majority of Indians dont buy degrees. Only recognised, well known universities are respected abroad. Others dont get foreign jobs just with their degree, they work in India, gain some experience then move to other places. My point with that entire paragraph was the surge in Indians is not due to CECA, its due to globalisation. 

Your comment basically shows you haven't read my post carefully and you're just jumping to conclusions that suit your prejudice. Even after explicitly stating this surge is not due to Indian superiority in any skill, rather its a consequence of globalisation and abundance of supply, you still make the conclusions you want to make."

From [this article from this july](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/share-of-ep-holders-from-india-has-roughly-doubled-since-2005) when LMW stirred another kerfuffle in parliament:

- ""THE share of Employment Pass (EP) holders from India has roughly doubled from about one-seventh in 2005, to one-quarter in 2020.""

- There are 177000 Total EP holders in 2020, EPs increased by 112000 since 2005 -> there were 65000 EPs in 2005

It's not often I see/meet someone saying they could be doing jobs others are doing. If it does happen (people thinking they are more qualified than they really are) then it's no different than any other country. 

However, there are so many Singaporeans who keep assuming there must be other Singaporeans who are qualified enough to do the jobs foreigners do. Somehow it's become this narrative - how is it possible that nobody in Singapore can do these jobs. But the reality is, that is exactly what is happening in the job market. Singapore keeps creating jobs of a certain type (white collar managerial jobs), which no country's population is capable of fulfilling. This is not a reflection of SG people's ability, no country by itself will be able to fill the requirements of the jobs market SG creates.

The problem is that the jobs for people not wanting to be in the rat race or who are less able (the bottom 50%) do not have access to reasonably paying jobs that other rich countries have. 

If you guys try to force MNCs or big companies to hire the bottom 50-60%, they will simply stop coming here. There might be a 5 year phase where companies with existing operations can't leave immediately, so they stick around until they have to. And people make merry for those 5 years. But eventually, everyone will gtfo. Because if you think for a second that companies would rather hire bottom 60% of SG population over top 20% of other Asian countries, you're so so badly mistaken"

""IT is very systematic you say? Most of the time you may be required to learn on the job and not ask for training. If IT was systematic, you would not be clamoring for skill transfer. Even the GPs in India are much better than the GPs in SG. It's because of experience and diversity.""

Yes it's very systematic. For key as developer is more different as they write the codes and create the system itself.  Skill transfer is dependent on the person itself. Not all employees willing to share their skills be it FT or local. In my job, yes it's very systematic. with basic knowledge and problem solving, you can solve most of the issue.

Experience and diversity??. Is SG education not diversified enough?. What are the points of doing internship and getting lower pay if its not to experience real working environment?..

It’s about livelihood and opportunities to learn and to grow locally without additional competition for rank and file pmet jobs regardless of race. It’s pure math. More people = more competition.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,HedonisticSwine,"Your argument here is just flawed. You are (1) asking us to imagine a scenario which did/has not occurred, and (2) predicting the psyche that Singaporeans will have towards that scenario. Both of this is highly unfair arguments to make. 

(1) While you might want us to imagine that scenario, the fact is that this is not the problem at hand. The problem we are addressing is the influx of Indians taking PMET jobs, not Caucasians, not Chinese. So stick to the original scenario and don't distract reader (or yourself) from what is currently at play. 

(2) Even if we grant you that and imagine that scenario, it still doesn't give you the right to say ""this is how you will feel"". You are not us and more importantly, you are trying the generalize the entire population by making such accusations. The bigger issue here is, why do you think that is how we will respond? Just as how you perceived Singaporeans have judged the Indians, you too have judged us (without concrete evidence, I might add). 

Please don't make such arguments. Just stick to facts and your feelings; those I can respect. But when you try to project onto Singaporeans, that's where you are not making sound arguments. 

P.S. I am not in favor of the motion brought by LMW in the parliament and I think the CECA issue is blown out-of-proportion with racial undertone.",1,1631716998,2021-09-15 14:43:18,"Your argument here is just flawed.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,parchedranger,"I agree with some of what you have written. Construction was leveraged and contributed to GDP growth in SG because of cheap manual labour from countries like Bangladesh and India. But software services is a huge export of India. There is no dearth of talent, despite some bad ones. 
Sg invested in groomimg their population towards finance / business but not technology. During the same time, India groomed its resources in Tech. Because of the population and the affinity to technology any skill shortage anywhere can be plugged by looking into India.
If you go to a shop to buy something either you pay whatever is written on the price tag or try to get a goo deal. It is the same with MNCs. Why would they pay for training someone when they could get someone job ready.
Again the point of contention is, if the MNCs bring in folks from elsewhere in exchange they create roles for the locals too. If there is too much force on the MNCs for them it is very easy to shift jobs elsewhere. India offers very good real estate and savings to them. It would just be a matter of time.

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,throw_way772,"Okay, I don’t wanna be hotheaded because that will get us nowhere, so let me explain. 

Just like the Chinese community has several dialect groups, the Indian community has several linguistic groups. Tamil, Malayalam, Punjabi, Bengali, and Hindi have been the 5 most dominant Indian languages here (in rough descending order) since Raffles founded the colony. There are substantial numbers of non-Tamil Singaporean Indians in the community that have long, long ancestral history here, just as long as anyone else.

Your friend is right that there is more difference between a Tamil and Hindi speaker (completely different languages) than a Canto and Teochew speaker (mildly different variations of Chinese) but in the context of Singapore we are all Singaporean and the divisions in our ancestral homeland shouldn’t matter here.

I don’t blame you for not knowing much because our dumb education system omits a lot of information about our history, but Google is free. Pritam Singh, Kishore Mahbubani, Subhas Anandan, Hri Kumar Nair, Inderjit Singh, Sivakant Tiwari, Davinder Singh, to name a few: all famous non-Tamil-speaking Indian Singaporeans.

The four official languages do not paint the full picture. There is no Hokkien or Canto or Arabic or Javanese or Punjabi or Hindi in the official languages list but they are every bit as “Singaporean” as Mandarin or Tamil.

Back to movies: Until the early 2010s most Indian movies in Singapore (of all languages) were screened in smaller independent cinemas in Little India or Shaw Tower. These small Indian cinemas gradually wound down operations or went out of business entirely, so GV swooped in and took over the screenings.

Exactly. The genuinely talented ones aren't here - they're at SF. 

The Indian startups give me pause to be honest. When I was in hotel management, the local OYO representatives were extremely aggressive in asking for partnerships but it turned out to be hot air. Something smelled off when they even offered to get Ritesh Agarwal to meet me and my boss.

I went to look at CECA. Only clause on dependents is this:

>For natural persons of a Party who have been granted the right to long term temporary entry and have been allowed to bring in their spouses or dependants, a Party shall, upon application, grant the accompanying spouses or dependants of the other Party the right to work as managers, executives or specialists (as defined in paragraphs 2(f)(i) to (iii) of Article 9.2), **subject to its relevant licensing, administrative and registration requirements.** Such spouses or dependants can apply independently in their own capacity (and not necessarily as accompanying spouses or dependants) and shall not be barred by the Party granting them the right to work from taking up employment in a category other than that of managers, executives, or specialists solely on the ground that they as the accompanying spouses or dependants are already employed in its territory as managers, executives or specialists.

Bolded parts says it's still subject to our normal immigration rules, so this clause have or don't have basically no difference. Only difference is that the second part says cannot reject them on the sole basis that their spouse is already working here. Can still reject them for other reasons.

1. Like you are underwhelmed by Indians in SG, many corporates are underwhelmed by Singaporean talent. They have shared with government many times esp their ability to question/challenge.
2. if Indians leave it is of no consequence to India/Indians and also for Singapore except might be for some flux

On. broader points

1. Have you ever seen a grab or Uber drive happy? 
2. VCs are smarter than you and me because it is their money / risks
3. Go to the future and see the learning that India and China would have had due to failures at others expense like US had in dotcom era

On caste point, When you say Indian is it Hindu, Muslim or Christian ? Goan , maharastian or parsis? Nouveau rich or middle class as in Singapore? What do you mean by caste? All too hazy

If I compare with class divide in Singapore between super rich and poor then most Indian discrimination will look feeble esp when the law has abolished any discrimination . In Singapore people you can discriminate by class and still it is completely legal but in India you will go to jail

A foreigner's perspective on the CECA issue,souna313313,"> if OYOs future is as grave as you say then why Microsoft would invest even a few weeks back?

Because Microsoft only put $5m into OYO and let them use Microsoft Azure at a heavily reduced rate. Which, let's be frank, is nothing to Microsoft when their net income for FY2021 was $61bn. If MS genuinely believes in OYO we'd be seeing that number in the billions, not millions like how they acquired ZeniMax for $7.5bn.

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",heere,"I think the backlash against CECA is a symptom of the underlying root cause of growing inequality. There has been a push-back against globalization that has been happening across the world in the last decade. Brexit, Trump, and the success of populist nationalist parties are all manifestations of this push-back.

Those who have not benefited from the fruits of globalization feel indignant at the massive wealth gap. They think globalization has benefited a small privileged elite, but not them. They think it is unfair that they should pay the price for bankers’ failings.

There has been a push-back against globalization that has been happening across the world in the last decade. Brexit, Trump, and the success of populist nationalist parties are all manifestations of this push-back.

Those who have not benefited from the fruits of globalization feel indignant at the massive wealth gap. They think globalization has benefited a small privileged elite, but not them. They think it is unfair that they should pay the price for bankers’ failings.

Like most have said here, we are well aware of globalisation and I believe many of us appreciate that we are well connected with the rest of the world and MNCs are able to come to our country to create quality jobs and we are able to attract talented people to come and make meaningful contributions to our country.

The first problem is pay stagnation. I have a short working career (15 years) and I have worked in a global eng mnc before. While I am not aware of the job market rate now for fresh uni grads, I was offered 2.5k during the mid 2000s when I was a fresh uni grad. In 2021, I am still seeing less than 2k offered for uni grads at job sites now, so it is quite sad to see that. With rising costs of living, it is not surprising to see talented people moving overseas to work or hopping on to more lucrative industries. Raising wages for locals will help our talented grads stay here.

The 'quantity over quality' could well apply to everyone including locals but just looking at the Changi Business Park case study today, we understand why OYK said some have mentioned we had lost a part of Singapore. Within companies, there may be certain groups of workers from certain countries too. It could be due to the hiring manager or just familiarity of the workers who like to work with people with the same nationality.  I experienced that while working in the mnc and while most of the foreigners I worked with are decent, honest workers, a few unfortunately just do not make the grade. Thus, vetting the quality of workers coming in is important and I hope companies should hire people on merit and not because they are 'low cost'. (e.g. 2 foreigners over one local). For sure, the talented foreigner will help complement our local workforce.

The last point is integration. While I was working in the mnc, I was able to communicate well with my dept colleagues, which were a mix of locals and foreigners when I first joined. But slowly over the years, I witnessed some of my local colleagues moving on to other depts or other companies. Finally I was the only local left in my dept until I left my company a few years ago. Many of my colleagues starting talking more in their local dialect in the office and slowly we had lost common topics to talk about. My work which is project related didn't helped at all as some of them had to travel for projects and had their own families after work. Thus there was a lack of bonding and the office gradually became 'cold'. While this is my own personal experience, I feel it could be happening in other companies too. 

One way I see to improve this situation is volunteering activities to integrate locals and foreigners. But it depends on the companies and I have noticed that volunteering rates are low among working PMETs (the biggest groups I have witnessed in events are students getting CIP points and retired seniors)

To end off, I would like to say if we could improve on the 3 points above, I feel locals will be more accepting of globalisation (CECA or other FTAs) happening on our shores.",9,1625666914,2021-07-07 14:08:34,"Depressed wages, 'quantity over quality' talent coming here and the lack of integration of foreigners and locals are the main issues I observe on the ground over the years which have made us come to witness this debate today in 2021.

>As mentioned in parliament, and of official government records, let's reiterate that CECA does not allow the free movement of natural persons (i.e. immigration).

Under [chapter 9](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/non-financial-assistance/for-companies/free-trade-agreements/CECA_India/Legal_Text/Chapter9_Movement_of_Natural_Persons) Singaporeans and Indians are granted entry to India and Singapore for various periods (2month to 3 years). In terms of competition, you do not need immigration to increase the number of people able to work in a region.

The main concern about **temporary** foreign workers is 2 fold:

1. Remittance - which means capital is not recirculated in the economy leading to a less than expected money multiplier. This means the economy may not benefit as much if locals were hired since local spending would spend more in the local economy than foreign workers
2. Path dependence - by hiring foreign workers, we ignore the more important question of developing the local workforce. Business may choose to simply get foreign workers and not invest in technology/schooling to train the next generation.Taken to the extreme, this means a continued dependency on foreign labor because we lack the infrastructure to shift to a local workforce even when cost of foreign worker increase to match the local workforce.

For a country like Singapore where we are already liberal in terms of trade, additional FTA has a diminishing impact on the benefits. Most of the gains from FDI for instance would not have much spillovers.

That is not to say the net impact of CECA is negative, in fact, I believe it is the opposite, but currently, we have too little data to make any conclusion on the magnitude of the impact.",9,1625646964,2021-07-07 08:36:04,"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics#:~:text=Far%2Dright%20politics%2C%20also%20referred,having%20nativist%20ideologies%20and%20tendencies.

Whether I'm right, wrong, or misguided is not material to me, so I will be disabling inbox responses. I just want to get some stuff off my chest. 

I am both happy and disturbed that there are those who seek to defend PSP and/or continue to lambast CECA for what it is not. Happy, because based on what little they can cobble up, I know that they know, in their heart of hearts, that their position is indefensible. They *know*, and that is why they cling to minor objections like ""If the Government released the numbers earlier, it'd have put to rest all these concerns!"" or ""They're not hearing the cries of the people!""

They *know* that they lost the point, and hence why they shift goalposts, accuse gaslighting, get mired in pedantry, and otherwise struggle with trying to find some coherent ground to stand on. 

But I am also disturbed. Because this is the reaction from what is an intellectually dishonest group of people - and I don't care that they are intellectually dishonest to others. I feel sad and disappointed that they are intellectually dishonest to themselves. They cannot reconcile the disjunction in their brain and ""lived experiences"" with the statistics and data placed before them, and as such try to concoct means and ways to make sense of it all. And the outcome they reach is that *it's someone else's fault*. Conveniently, the Government's. Less conveniently but still the same, the Indian FTs'. The list goes on - but at no point will they receive the tragic but comforting release of looking themselves in the mirror. 

For example - to the redditor who claimed that your supplier hired an Indian instead of a local, why didn't you change supplier? Why didn't you protest the injustice of it all, and put your money where your mouth is? If it wasn't your decision - why didn't you protest your boss's complicity and quit? *You know why*. And if you were even an ounce more honest with yourself, you would've known why you didn't bother asking your supplier *why he hired an Indian* and tried to understand what pains he was going through. And if you were two ounces more honest with yourself, you would know that there is a wide gap of responsibility between Government policy and what business decisions your supplier takes. 

But you don't. You instead tout him as an example about how CECA BAD. 

The ills of globalization are not new to anyone paying any semblance of attention. Xenophobia and nationalism has been on the rise since, roughly, the mid-2000s. The US just concluded 4 years of a presidency where they flirted with the idea of anti-intellectual governance for the sake of ""sticking it to the Man"". Brexit *actually* occurred. In Japan, hikikomori-ism is a significant social issue. In China, 躺平 is the new buzzword. 

The effects of an open, global economic market where labour competition is not confined to one's national boundaries are recent phenomena - but the trend and reactions are not dissimilar. 

It is no wonder that Singaporeans feel unsafe. But the fact of the matter is *no one feels safe* - and by no one, I mean *literally no one in any mature economy*. People who can compete, thrive in an environment where their strengths are maximised and weaknesses minimised; conversely, people who can't compete, will stack up at the wrong end of the distribution curve. 

This is known. This is not news. It is sobering, tragic, disheartening - but it is not news. 

I can say with some compassion that I understand why people will lash out and seek someone to blame. It is a thoroughly bitter pill to swallow, when the pill has on its casing ""You're not good enough"". The mental backlash is not easy to accept, and it is no wonder that people will seek easy answers - even if they know, deep down, that those answers are wrong. 

What, then? Because the alternative - accepting that life is suffering and we're all doomed - seems to be horrible, yes? 

I think we should start by being honest with ourselves. And I mean *brutally* honest. Those who are blessed to work in/with MNCs or foreigners know how hungry some of these foreigners are. Anecdotally, I know Taiwanese entrepreneurs who come to Singapore to set up companies, not because they don't believe in the Taiwan Dream, but because it's easier to get a Singapore company marketed. *To leave their home, families, and loved ones to pursue a chance of success* - that is the type of hunger and thirst that we, as economic units, have to come up against. 

So at the individual level, those who can, must fight. We have to do what we can to be able to tell ourselves, ""at least we tried"". If that means holding our noses and taking the SkillsFuture credits to do what little reskilling we can, that's what it takes. If it means going on networking sessions to simultaneously put ourselves out there but also to figure out where new business niches may come up - and then putting in the work to get that out there - then that's what it takes. Another anecdote - a few years ago, a friend was telling me about a business plan, trying to bring quality tea to the masses (think bubble tea but with proper brewed tea). He never acted on the idea. Now, there are a number of outfits who purport to put that idea out there. Is that a missed opportunity? Is my friend someone who never tried? Does he look at those outfits and wonder to himself? 

Can we each make choices that will let us sleep at night without wondering to ourselves, ""have we tried our best?"" 

But I am also aware - at the end of the day, it is the minority of the minority who will succeed. Most people are not able to put themselves through the struggles of business or job creation and suffer while not lamenting failure. They may have real reasons why they can't - a mortgage, a family, a phobia, a lack of resources and/or know-how. 

And that's fine. 

My comfort is that the ability of mature economies to support hikikomoris or people who are ""lying flat"" is an indication that on a macro level, we're doing alright. There are options for people who can only or choose only to eke out a subsistence level of living. That's not to say that we should all resign our fate to that - but it is a social safety net to know that there are options out there that let people survive while figuring a way out. And furthermore, life is not about chasing the dollar, the fanciest car, or the most glamourous house. So it is actually okay, if we end up not being able to dine in a Michelin-star restaurant or live in Queen Astrid Park. There is a wide spectrum between subsistence level survival and the 0.1%. 

So long as we're honest to ourselves, and we lead a life of what we choose to strive towards based on an honest assessment of ourselves, I think that's good enough. And our economy can sustain that (thus far). So we aren't in an apocalyptic stage.

This term might seem innocent but it’s the biggest loophole Indian WITCH contracting companies ship boat loads of people to US. Hire in India -> transfer to US branch of the company -> subcontract workers to US companies with promise of applying full work visa for them. There’s almost no quality control with this loophole. 

“ It is important to understand the role that FTAs play in foreign trade and the importance of trade to the continuous survival of Singapore. Total trade by Singapore amounts to $1.5trillion (sauce: OYK Speech). Let that sink in. A country of 5.6m (citizen population:3.6+m) trading at $1.5t.”

What I like to find out is the number of Employment Passes (EP) given out in a year and how does it compare to what other countries are doing. I'm using the H1B visas in the US as a point of reference, and while not entirely apples to apples, i think it is close. 

The H1B visas are non-immigrant visas that allow firms to bring in skilled workers/professions for jobs that they cannot find a US resident to fill. Information about H1B visas can be found here: [https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations) . The H1B visa seems most similar to EP in Singapore. It's not limited to the tech industry, although i would guess the majority of the visas are given out to tech workers. It has an annual quota of 85,000 (info in the link) new visas every year. As a percentage of the US population, that's minuscule, but that's not a fair comparison since Singapore is a city state. Instead, I like to restrict the population to just the tech hubs in the US. The Bay Area (silicon valley) has a population of 7+ mil. The Seattle metropolitan area (Amazon, Microsoft and others) has a population of 3.9 mil. Austin has a population of 0.9 mil. New York city has a population of 8+ mil. For New York city, there is a wide range of professions and tech jobs may be in the minority. However, quite a number of H1B visa holders also work in finance, so let's assume 50% of the jobs there will employ H1B holders. This gives us an effective population of 4+ mil for New York City. Taken in total, the overall population becomes 15.8 mil. This is probably a conservative estimate since it leaves out places like Chicago city, Florida and the LA metropolitan area, which includes, for example, Qualcomm in San Diego. So, the number of new H1B visas issued out every year, as a percentage of 15.8 mil is 0.5%.

Glad to hear that your situation has improved now.

I had similar experiences as you while working in a global mnc few years ago. As I was in the eng field, most of my colleagues were from SEA, China and India. 

While I respect my colleagues and get on well with them, over time the relationship may change. Especially when we are the only local left in the dept. Like you, I also felt like a foreigner in my own country.

I personally experienced the meetings like you and also hear my colleagues speaking in their own dialects during work. During lunch, they would eat with their colleagues from other dept( same nationality too) and after work, they would go home as most of them had their own families. Another roadblock was that they had brought their own lunchbox (prepared at home due to their diet) and very very seldom go out to eat at hawker centers too. Of course this is my own experience and may not apply to other people.

So I thought to myself...when is a good time for us to interact informally? 

Most of my colleagues were decent family people who came to work only and normally don't go out to socialise unnecessary. These were two aspects which I admire.

Maybe it was also due to my introverted personality but over time, we lost common topics to talk about and the office gradually became 'cold'. When the time came to move on, I quitted.

While I am glad to see this topic being debated, I am grateful for the opportunities offered in a mnc when I was working with them and I also learnt a great deal from them too. No doubt they help to complement our local workforce and have better technical working experiences/conversation skills.

I stress that I am still on good terms with my ex colleagues, but working day by day with each other, it sure doesn't feel like I was working in Singapore. So to end off, I hope that moving forward, there has to be some balance in our FTAs and also more robust company policies so it doesn't result in too many incoming workers from one country only and alienating the locals.",6,1625668620,2021-07-07 14:37:00,"Thanks for sharing your experiences and sorry to hear about your wife's discrimination.

This does not mean Singapore should start importing till every 9/10 is a foreigner but it's an example of a mutually beneficial economic relationship. 

Note: I am saying economic specifically because you still need to balance the population numbers (foreigner and local alike) with other constraints like infrastructure, healthcare, social integration and so on."

It’s time to address the issue. The tripartite framework is based a lot on negotiation and good faith. But it’s not entirely clear what happens when people violate that. For example, we know that there are penalties, but we don’t know who is being penalised. The industry insiders may know, but the general public applying for jobs do not. In my view, they should address the issue like how they’ve publicly announced which worksites have to close because they were not respecting social distancing rules.

These are all *negative externalities*. Granted, not all of them can be solved by the same solution.

The rich and upper middle class whom I **specifically** said were the disproportionate beneficiaries of globalization.

Let me clarify something here: I happen to be a huge beneficiary of globalization, and I naturally am all for it. I happen to be in a globalized industry with very cosmopolitan employees. But this discussion is about how people in Singapore perceive this, and most of them are not rich or upper middle-class.

If you are in the top 8% who happen to buy condos, 90% of the time (I recognize that some old-money industries are not affected) you should not be complaining about globalization because you are the grand winners of globalization. I have this conversation with very conservative colleagues all the time and it blows my mind how stupid it is to hear an American foreign worker (I refuse to use the term expatriate) advocating against globalization when he owes his job to it.

But if you don't happen to be in that category (the other 92%), things get a lot more murky. If you happen to be a technician rather than an engineer, you will be acutely aware that the availability of workers as skilled as you are from other Southeast Asian countries exerts downward pressure on your salary. You'd naturally be wondering if things would be a lot better if the government had more restrictive policies on foreign employment.

In this case, the industry most affected is IT. If you were an IT worker, you'd be wondering how demand for your skills would be affected without so much globalization. Let's be honest here: every large company needs an IT guy, and it's pretty obvious that with less globalization the number of companies wouldn't shrink as much as the pool of Indian IT professionals, who are *legion*.

If you ask \*me\* I would of course say I am very pleased that I can hire cheap IT workers to assist my department. But I'm not blind to the idea that IT graduates would be frustrated at the enormous competition from Indian IT grads depressing their salary averages.",30,1625658499,2021-07-07 11:48:19,"The rich and upper middle class whom I **specifically** said were the disproportionate beneficiaries of globalization.

You can have high numbers of foreigners in Singapore and yet have low citizen unemployment rate and rising wages as the data shows. 

This is the perfect embodiment of an ""us vs them"" or should I say afraid of losing out / afraid of dying shallow thinking that we need to look beyond. It can be a mutually beneficial economic relationship.


If you go to UAE, every 9 persons out of 10 will be a foreigner and 1 Emirati. It does not mean the Emirati is suffering due to the influx of dark skinned people. In fact, it's the opposite since an average Emirati has benefitted massively from all the foreigners UAE employs. This does not mean Singapore should start importing till every 9/10 is a foreigner but it's an example of a mutually beneficial economic relationship.

Just because you see more dark people in CBP does not mean that Singaporeans are losing out economically. You can have high numbers of foreigners in Singapore and yet have low citizen unemployment rate and rising wages as the data shows.

Is it truly accurate data, though? Wouldn't you agree that the data could be skewed because of things like Grab/Foodpanda, or even the SGUnited traineeships or even the apprenticeship courses? What is the data methodology behind the numbers?

>This is the perfect embodiment of an ""us vs them"" or should I say kiasu / kiasu shallow thinking that we need to look beyond. It can be a mutually beneficial economic relationship.

Now that's putting words in my mouth. I simply said the data doesn't match what people see on the ground. I never said the foreigner vs local is a bad thing either. Why? Because it doesn't affect me tangibly. Even the ""mutual benefit"" thing you mentioned, I have no clue.

>Note: I am saying economic specifically because you still need to balance the population numbers (foreigner and local alike) with other constraints like infrastructure, healthcare, social integration and so on.

Of course",2,1625641089,2021-07-07 06:58:09,"It takes tremendous amount  of human resourcework to bring these CECA people into the company.  


Getting rid of them takes even more break contract paperwork and the person who approved  interviewed them gets the shit.   


So it is better to cover up and hopefully the next CECA is not as bad- but the shit happens again .  


The looses are usually Malaysian who gets replaced with seemingly better educated and  cheaper option.  


But at the end of the day, the local companies loose the most because the products goes out bad and they get sued by the customer. The overall quality of the Singapore brand got downgraded.  


Give you some examples.  


1) PHD qualified electronic engineer solders components on a PCB without going through the hole. All the components stand on the PCBs like freaking long legged spiders.   


2) CNC operator broke 3 x $100 please cutters on 1st day. On the phone all the time asking his friend how to do this and that.  


3) Masters software programmer's code have shit loads of other peoples code ( he copied and paste)    did not know have to remove them when asked.

4) Team of 4 design a system using 36V 3A over 20 meters using single core telephone wires and wonder about intermittent supply    
We are not paying these people peanuts- by the way. They are supposed to be qualified.  


Hard working, obedient and responsive- yes sir yes sir ? probably.   


 technical talent knowledge as advertised? That is what the noise is about.   


Waste money"

Heck, I wonder if they even listened to the >2hrs of ministerial statement and debate in parliament.",justastatistic,"I agree completely and I am not saying that no action should be taken to address the concerns of the people (regardless of whether the concerns are backed by data or not). This is a massive perception problem that rears its ugly head during every major crisis as people start getting retrenched or lose their incomes. 

During the Asian economic crisis years, it was the Hong Kongers offered an easy path to PR in Singapore who were targetted and blamed for property cost rises. 

During GFC 2009 and a couple of years after, there was a big rise anti-foreigner sentiment accompanied by opposition to the population white paper. 

During Covid, we see the same situation repeat this time primarily against Indians despite CECA being in place for literally 15+ years. 

All of the above had political fallouts. I hope the policy makers are looking at data on the ground. Not just economic but sentimental. For example, despite the actual data:

An analogy is that I think of it like a test - there's a score out of 100.

The question is what is a passing score (or conversely, what is a failure score)? What are the metrics we should measure it by? How do we add scores or deduct scores? 

0 Covid cases? 0 death cases (and do you measure it as a percentage of the population)? 0 interruption to business? Access to vaccines? Citizen sentiment? 

You can list all these factors and come to an overall score. And that overall score is going to vary depending on priorities / definitions. For example, [Bloomberg's score focuses on business reopening](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ob9hlx/singapore_drops_to_13_in_updated_bloomberg_covid/h3mubya/). NZ's way is to go for 0 Covid, and Australia has snap lockdowns. 

When your initial comment talks about ""obfuscate their failures"", my response is therefore that it depends on the definition of failure.

Going back to my analogy of the score out of 100, your examples go towards deducting the score (I'm not arguing here whether your examples count as failures). The question is then: (a) how much does it deduct the score? (e.g. does it deduct by 1 point? 5 points? 10 points?) (b) after all the deductions, do we still get a passing mark (say, is it still 75/100? 51/100? 30/100?).

I say this because I feel that there's a narrative in r/singapore that the Singapore government has only a 30/100 (or failing) mark - which is why we get you say that there's been ""failures in other areas like response to Covid"". 

Your examples above point to singular issues which you then agglomerate into a ""general lack of proactive measures"", but to me, it doesn't answer the question of whether there is an overall failure.

Note: this also doesn't talk about the question of comparison with other countries.

I think that until this question of what ""failure"" means is worked out, there's no point having a discussion (in general, not with you in specific). What each side will do is bring up examples like ""look we let in so many Indians"" (or in more PC terms) or ""look at our vaccination rates! Procuring so many vaccines doesn't happen in a vacuum or without proactive steps"" - without going into the heart of the matter, which is ""how do we define failure""?",4,1625645655,2021-07-07 08:14:15,"Hmm that's not really my point.

I simply said the data doesn't match what people see on the ground. I never said the foreigner vs local is a bad thing either. Why? Because it doesn't affect me tangibly. Even the ""mutual benefit"" thing you mentioned, I have no clue.

People on the ground can be horrendously wrong in their perception vs the actual facts or reality and this is proven across the world in various surveys. 

>1. Happiness: we think our fellow Singaporeans are much more miserable than surveys of happiness show. We guess that only 47% of Singaporeans would say they are very or rather happy, when actually 93% say they are in a recent representative survey.
2. Wealth of the bottom 70%: we asked people to guess what proportion of total wealth the least wealthy 70% in Singapore owned – our guess would seem reasonable at 37% but this majority of the population actually own only 19% of wealth in Singapore.
3. Home-owners: By ‘owned’, we mean owning the home outright or buying it with the help of
a mortgage or other loan. As much as we recognise the high cost of property in Singapore,
91% of Singaporeans are actually home-owners. Our guess was that only 68% of
Singaporeans own their homes.
4. Health spending: we think we spend four times as much as we actually do on our health. We
think we spend 21% of our total GDP on health expenditure when in fact we only spend 5%.
If our guess was right, this would be the equivalent of an extra SGD 65bn spending on health.
5. Trump: Fieldwork for the survey was conducted the month before the presidential election in
the US – so we asked who people thought would win. And like the vast majority of countries
– along with nearly all pundits – we were wrong: 67% thought Clinton would win and only
14% saw the Trump victory coming.

Another example: https://www.ipsos.com/en-sg/perception-vs-reality-singaporeans-most-accurate-apac

>Good health: In Singapore we think other people report their health as worse than they actually are, and in fact, we are among the least accurate in our beliefs. Our average guess is that only 55% of people say their health is good or very good, when actually 81% say their health is good or very good. The Asia Pacific region average guess is 55% for people saying their health is good or very good, while 9% guessed their health was poor.

>Foreign-born prisoners: We think that immigrants make up a much greater proportion of the Singapore prison population than they actually do. We guessed an average of 30% of all prisoners share of the overall population at about 30%. In Asia Pacific, the average guess was 22%.

>Murder rate: The large majority of people in Singapore think the murder rate is higher now  or the same as 2000, when it is actually around 78% lower. About 3 in 10 (34%) think that it's higher, 31% think it's about the same, and only 28% correctly guess that it is lower. Across the Asia Pacific, 74% think the murder rate is higher or the same.

>Teenage pregnancy: We hugely overestimate the proportion of 15-19 year old women and girls giving birth each year across the Asia Pacific region. Singapore thinks 11% of Singaporean teenage girls give birth each year (about one in ten), when the actual figure is only 0.4%. The Asia Pacific average guess is 21%.

>Diabetes: People in every country significantly overestimate the prevalence of diabetes, including those in Asia Pacific. We think that 35% of people in Singapore have diabetes, when the actual figure is around 11%. The Asia Pacific average guess was 35%.

>Facebook membership: All countries also overestimate Facebook membership, with an average guess that 83% of Singapore aged 13+ have a Facebook account, when the actual figure is 67%. The Asia Pacific average guess was 71%.

>Vehicles: Most countries overestimate the number of registered vehicles per 100 people with the Asia Pacific average guess being 84%. Singapore estimated the number of registered vehicles per 100 people at 53 (approximately 1 vehicle for every 2 persons) when the actual number is just 18 (approximately 1 vehicle for every 5 persons).

>Suicide: There is a real split in accuracy on the proportion of deaths by suicide among young people. Singapore estimated the proportion of deaths of women aged 15-24 due to suicide was 18% when the actual figure was 34%. Estimates for the deaths of young men due to suicide was 18% when the actual number was 27%.

>Vaccines: There are a wide variety of views among Asia Pacific countries when it comes to beliefs around the link between some vaccines and autism in healthy children despite the claim being widely discredited. In Singapore 20% believe the statement to be true and 48% say they don't know, with 32% saying it is false. Across the Asia Pacific region, 22% said the claim was true while 36% said it was false.

>Terrorism: Most countries in the Asia Pacific do not believe deaths from terrorist attacks are lower in the recent years, despite that being the case in many. In Singapore, 22% say that deaths from terrorist attacks were lower between 2002 and 2016 than they were between 1985 and 2000, a further 40% said about the same, while 24% think deaths from terrorism were higher over the last 15 years. In reality, deaths from terrorist attacks dropped from 5 to 0 over that time period. In the Asia Pacific region as a whole, one third (33%) believed there were more terror related deaths, 35% said about the same and 19% said there were less deaths.

>Manpower Minister Josephine Teo and Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam have both referred to PWM as “minimum wage plus”, a point which union leaders echoed.

**Edited to add this**: [Here](https://youtu.be/jbqdqevYUXA) is a clip of SM Tharman speaking about the PWM in Parliament, at about 40 secs into the video, he says:

>I would not - and I say this to *everyone* *from all sides* (here he gestures in the general direction of MP Gan Siow Huang, who had just stood up to rebut MP Jamus Lim) - I would not exaggerate the differences between the PWM model and the minimum wage model. The PWM model is a minimum wage plus and it is a sectoral approach.

And researchers from LKY SPP agree with this analysis saying [here](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/what-is-the-progressive-wage-model-and-is-it-better-than-a-minimum-wage) that:

>\[T\]he most significant difference is the PWM's wage ladder. It is effectively a sectoral minimum wage, set through a tripartite negotiation process involving government, union and other industry representatives. In addition to setting a minimum wage, they also set wage rungs, giving workers a way to seek out a pay increase by improving their skills.  
>  
>""In a sense, the PWM is really a sectoral minimum wage. But it could also be considered a minimum wage plus, because it specifies an income and skills ladder that goes beyond the flat minimum,"" said Professor Ho.

The PWM is a negotiated understanding under the tripartite framework — i.e. government, labour unions, and businesses. There will invariably be all sorts of friction on the part of different stakeholders, as you’ve rightly alluded to.

My point is that if they just recognised and conceded that they‘ve implemented *a form of minimum wage*, we could’ve moved past that silly debate and think about what *else* can be done to improve PWM right at the outset.

And it is not that they did not have enough Ministers in cabinet with the ability to explain to people the details and the merits of the PWM or FTAs. Its a general patronising (paternalistic in you words) attitude that PAP has, even after 2011. They likely believe that GE2011 results was a fluke, and that they can capture the swing and GRC back. GE2015 results, being a unique election after LKY's death, swung back in PAP's favour, and they doubled down with the AHTC matter and paternalistic/patronising way of brushing citizen's concerns away. There somehow seems to be early signs of reconciliation within the PAP rank, that the GE2011 results was more than a fluke, after GE2020 results came out. Its bad enough that there are 12 Opposition members. It is worst that 2 GRCs were very very close (<3500 votes) to being lost with 4 more Ministers losing. So hopefully OYK will continue more of the Tharman/Lawrence Wong style than Shanmugam/CCS style. 



Even now, I dnt think they have explained the CECA in a way that ppl will see the inherent benefit esp to those from 20-40th percentile of income earners. Singapore, besides Indonesia, is the only ASEAN country to be in the top 10 Importer country list of India. While Indonesia exports lots of Palm Oil and Raw Material to India, Singapore exports Electronics and Petrochemical products (eg. PP/PE resins). The fact that Singapore is the only country in ASEAN to have a FTA agreement with India, means 1) We are able to attract and retain investors in the Manufacturing Sector, as the cost of exporting would be relatively cheaper from SG to India than from emerging economies like Thailand/Vietnam/Indonesia. And we do this by letting low-tech low-wage manufacturing processes to move into Thailand/Vietnam, and retain high-tech high-wage manufacturing processes like Assembly and Testing in Singapore. 2) We get a headstart in 2005, when no one else in ASEAN was looking at India. This is similar to how Singapore invested in Electronics sector in the 70s way ahead of any other country in ASEAN. 

Somehow, the CECA debate is a very convenient smoke screen for not only the nativist/racist arguementators but also the PAP, that is happy that the attention is diverted from other pertinent issues like unfair employment, cost of living, income inequality, etc. Hence why, I'd rather the data needed to address the issues brought out by those bent on lynching CECA, be out quickly, so that we can move on to questions on housing, cost of living, employment practices and so on.",1,1625804997,2021-07-09 04:29:57,"1 leaves another one will come, sg has built the country to have good infra, no corruption and etc..if companies think leaving Singapore to another country to cut cost then by all means leave.

I think you can detect that tone when one reads LKY’s memoirs.

But perhaps it also helps to mark the tone adopted at the time for historical purposes.

The question today is whether it still works or can work. I really don’t think so.

You're right, its not about this. **I also do think we should have more data that is released.**

I work with data daily, and I'm fully aware of the constraints I have. I will say though that there is already a lot of data that has been released to work with; there is a lot available on singstat. I also disagree that there aren't a lot of papers published on our local scene. There's quite plenty lol

And, as someone who is on a team doing a research piece now as well, you often don't need specific datasets they are choosing to not release. Even if you release more data, doesn't mean suddenly there'll be more pieces or papers on it what.

But I digress. Whether or not we should have more transparency is not relevant to my point. My main point is agreeing with the person before me, in that people who don't know how to interpret the data, which is the demographic I'm referring to, not academics or whatnot, or even worse, people who know how to interpret statistics who **deliberately use statistics to fit their own narrative** (Jamus Lim's parliamentary speech on the rule of law during the Parti Liyani uproar was particularly guilty of this), is worrying.

And if you really want to understand how statistics play into rl, imo, you need to walk the ground, volunteer, listen to people's stories, and not just complain on social media or forward chain messages on Whatsapp. Which I would say quite a significant portion of people just do not do!

Imo, what we are lacking is not data. It is a renewed sense of community, FROM community. Without that, I don't think it matters if we have data or no data.

i'm not a policymaker.

at the individual level, i think this quote is quite relevant: ""When you complain you make yourself a victim. Leave the situation, change the situation or accept it. All else is madness.""

so if an individual doesn't like the way the market works, either change the way a market economy functions, accept that that's how it functions, or leave the market economy.

it's like children asking ""why do i have to learn calculus? i'm never going to use it blah blah"". well that's the game, you just gotta play the game. of course there are also cognitive benefits to learning calculus that cannot be directly quantified, and there are also direct benefits if you ever decide to do anything that requires mathematical understanding. but for the most of us, it's just part of the game, we play it.

*but i do think the Singapore govt needs to make it clearer to people who didn't get to go to university on the first try that there are alternative pathways to higher education. Should also invest vastly more in education. Just to get a general boost of education for everyone. At the very least even if the degree becomes commonplace in Singapore, at least the Singaporean has had more years of education/is more educated, and has a qualification that can be recognised overseas as a degree. Of course, this is not relevant for people already some distance into their career, such people will probably be more in tune with their priorities in life and can decide how they want to proceed - if they want to upskill/reskill govt support is always there (so many bootcamps these days).

"PSP’s foreign talent policy proposals will hurt S’pore’s competitiveness, drive costs up: SMEs, economists",SherbetLimau,"I would partially disagree. The issue is not solely about ""entitled Singaporeans"". The issue is also linked to the median salary and the cost/standard of living.

For example, $2500 for an entry level job of a Software Engineer in Singapore is considered quite low (given that the median Singapore income is $4800). Most university educated Singaporeans would reject such a job. But this would be same in my home country as well (if I offered about 50% of the median salary for an entry level software engineer position, most applicants would reject it).

The issue is not solely about ""entitled Singaporeans"". The issue is also linked to the median salary and the cost/standard of living.

For example, $2500 for an entry level job of a Software Engineer in Singapore is considered quite low (given that the median Singapore income is $4800). Most university educated Singaporeans would reject such a job. But this would be same in my home country as well (if I offered about 50% of the median salary for an entry level software engineer position, most applicants would reject it).

While 2.5k for S-pass seems low, it is about the average starting wage of fresh graduates across all majors and schools. Perhaps we can give it a premium of 20%, marking it up to 3k.
