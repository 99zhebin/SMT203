The evangelicals in the united states don't tolerate other religions and think they are on a great crusade to save everyone by converting the non-believers. 

These are the people who will also be hostile to LGBT and try to mix religion with politics. As someone who believes that Singapore should be a secular society due to our multi-religious demographic and no religion having a true majority this is a phenomenon which needs to be looked into.

thirteen out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT,Bryanlegend,"Letâs not forget that during 2011 GE, 4 candidates infamously shared this letter to their constituents in an attempt to discredit an opposition candidate, by questioning if a gay candidate would pursue certain supposed âcausesâ in the political arena, knowing full well the political backlash that would be to occur if he said yes.

3/4 of these candidates have been voted into parliament for another term during 2020 GE, with one of them being our dear foreign minister who many liked for his articulation especially at the debates.

This is the letter in full:

âDear Friends of the Media,

Please find below a statement which is being sent on behalf of the PAP team contesting in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC. We would appreciate it very much if you could kindly publish the statement in full, and attribute it to the PAP team contesting in the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, led by Minister Vivian Balakrishnan.

Kindly call me at [phone number deleted] if you have any queries or if you need any clarification.

What is his agenda?

A video has been posted on the internet showing Vincent Wijeysingha participating at a forum which discussed the promotion of the gay cause in Singapore.

The discussion at the forum also touched on sex with boys and whether the age of consent for boys should be 14 years of age.

In the video, Wijeysingha was introduced as being from the SDP.

In addition to other comments, Wijeysingha stated: âI think the gay community has to rally ourselves. Perhaps one outcome of todayâs forum would be, for those of us who are interested, to come together to further consider how we can address the 377 issue as well as further rights issues in relation to gays and lesbians.â

We believe that candidates should be upfront about their political agenda and motives, so that voters are able to make an informed choice.

The issue is not Wijeysinghaâs sexual orientation. That is a matter for him.

The video raises the question on whether Wijeysingha will now pursue this cause in the political arena and what is the SDPâs position on the matter.

Vivian Balakrishnan

Note the sly link between LGBT rights/issues to paedophilia, as if Dr Vincentâs participation in the forum regarding LGBT causes immediately alludes to him being supportive of whatever is discussed in it. I really donât understand how people can claim the incumbent to be a progressive ally, when they wholeheartedly endorse rhetorics like this. 

Anyone else who says similar things will get shot down by LGBT allies immediately, but only the incumbents have the political power to still be voted in despite their stance and what they say.

thirteen out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT,Xylorios,"

Not too sure are you referring to ""Christians"" as a whole, or only some of the ""13"" ministers you are referring to. Because if you are referring to ""Christians"" as a whole, the [majority] of Christians are Catholic (38.5%), while the other 61.5% are made up of Protestant demoninations (made up of mostly Anglicans and Methodists in Singapore, but there are also Lutherans, Baptists, Pentecostals etc), and non-denominational such as the cityrevival and others. 

And with that, the Catholic Church does not view homosexuality as a ""lifestyle"" or something that it is a choice. This is the Catholic Church's official stance on LGBT. 

If you are referring to the 13 ministers I think it is only fair that you at least provide some information on whether they are Muslim, Catholic or Protestant, and which denomonation they belong to, because even within the Protestant umbrella, there are both LGBT affirming and supportive churches like free community church and anti-lgbt churches like Faith Community Baptist Church (organizers of the wear white movement).",10,1597309888,13/8/2020 9:11,  not too sure are you referring to christians as a whole or only some of the  ministers you are referring to because if you are referring to christians as a whole the majority of christians are catholic  while the other  are made up of protestant demoninations made up of mostly anglicans and methodists in singapore but there are also lutherans baptists pentecostals etc and nondenominational such as the cityrevival and others   and with that the catholic church does not view homosexuality as a lifestyle or something that it is a choice this is the catholic church is official stance on lgbt   if you are referring to the  ministers i think it is only fair that you at least provide some information on whether they are muslim catholic or protestant and which denomonation they belong to because even within the protestant umbrella there are both lgbt affirming and supportive churches like free community church and antilgbt churches like faith community baptist church organizers of the wear white movement,sure referring christians whole ministers referring referring christians whole majority christians catholic made protestant demoninations made mostly anglicans methodists singapore also lutherans baptists pentecostals etc nondenominational cityrevival others catholic church view homosexuality lifestyle something choice catholic church official stance lgbt referring ministers think fair least provide information whether muslim catholic protestant denomonation belong even within protestant umbrella lgbt affirming supportive churches like free community church antilgbt churches like faith community baptist church organizers wear white movement,Neutral,Neutral,sure referring christians whole ministers referring referring christians whole majority christians catholic made protestant demoninations made mostly anglicans methodists singapore also lutherans baptists pentecostals etc nondenominational cityrevival others catholic church view homosexuality lifestyle something choice catholic church official stance  referring ministers think fair least provide information whether muslim catholic protestant denomonation belong even within protestant umbrella  affirming supportive churches like free community church anti churches like faith community baptist church organizers wear white movement

Very poor premise to predicate anything. Does a greater disservice for the cause by this shallow approach.

PAP does it for votes and if you seen the quality of grassroots anywhere on the island you can take it that their support base is made up of uncles and aunties who have never progressed in their careers, utter nonsense in any discussion and have outdated views about society, marriage, relationship and human feelings.

My guess is that the majority of Singaporeans are Wordly, not homophobic or accommodating of other people's inclinations. PAP depends on grassroots clowns to campaign for them, do their deeds and its these narrowed minded simpletons and IBs they have to please. o to talk to them and you just laugh at their power of reasoning.

It makes little sense for SG politicians to involve themselves into this matter because firstly, PAP has always championed conservative, center right values - such as educating core, nuclear family values, giving subsidies to kids who buy flats near aging parents, allowing kids to use their CPF to pay for parents etc. The government isn't even supportive of single mothers of kids born out of wedlock. Secondly, you have the Muslim population that is almost 90% against LGBT and a significan't Christian population that is also against. It makes little sense to jeopardize your votes and standing by pandering to a something that will mean losing the support of the majority.

There are also even more pressing issues than LGBT rights for politicians. How to get singaporeans to have more kids so that singaporeans can stop blaming the government for bringing in more foreigners? How to secure better population sustainability?

Yes LGBQT rights are worth discussing. But trying to suggest that the reason such rights are not recognised because of a 13/20 number without any real analysis of the people is a really weak argument and does your own cause a disservice. These are the types of arguments that people on the other side will leap on to say that LGBQT people are crazy.

thirteen out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT,FiReBrAnDz,"Hmm, a CNN article is not exactly the best source to dissect the Catholic Church's complicated view on homosexuality .


Since this is about Singapore, we will firstly look at the Singapore's Archbishop stance on 377a repeal. You can find the entire nuanced letter [here]

In essence, he calls for Catholics to reject the act of repealing 377a as seen from.




Moving on, to the Vatican stance, it is imperative to understand that though Pope Francis has made great leaps forwards in welcoming the LGBTQ community, no doctrinal changes were made and he reaffirmed the Catholic Church teachings on homosexuality, especially it's position on marriage. You can see written [here]

CONCLUSION

11. The Church teaches that respect for homosexual persons can in no way lead to the approval of homosexual behavior or to the legal recognition of homosexual unions. The common good demands that the laws recognize, promote and protect the marital union as the basis of the family, the primordial cell of society. To legally recognize same-sex unions or to equate them with marriage, would mean not only approving deviant behavior, and therefore making it a model in today's society, but also masking fundamental values ??which belong to the common heritage of humanity. The Church cannot fail to defend such values ??for the good of men and of all of society.


Pope Francis is also alleged in saying that there is a 'gay lobby corruption"" in the Vatican [source], thought its credibility may be questioned. Though in the 2018 book, The Strength of a Vocation, Pope Francis is quoted as saying that gay clergy ""is a very serious issue"" that ""influences the life of the church"" and is therefore something he is concerned about."" and that "" such people should not be accepted into the ministry"" (sic)

I'm also not just talking about the public stances of politicians and their parties here. I am interested in their personal beliefs, which may differ from what they will support as lawmakers.

thirteen out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT,Bryanlegend,"I do think itâs a reasonable premise. The core teachings of the Muslim and Christian faith are still firmly etched against homosexuality and LGBT rights. It comes as no surprise should people from these faith strongly subscribe to what they are being taught, although I would agree that there is a growing of religious people who are more LGBT friendly in many senses.

However, the issue lies more in MPs and Ministers being openly religious, which while good for the religious themselves, has an effect on on our supposedly secular politics as well. It is the same reason why LKY claimed Singapore will be in trouble if our cabinet is full of Christians.

There is always the added pressure from religious individuals who might lobby against religious politicians. If politicians are too reliant on their religious base, they would think twice before going against the prevailing religious beliefs, even if their personal convictions might be different.

The more crucial issue with them is with regards to being openly Christian (I.e. placing hand on the bible).

thirteen out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT,pingmr,"I think it is valid to note that Christians are *extremely* over-represented in the Cabinet.

According to the 2011 census, the national average for Christians is 18.3 percent. In a group of 20 people that would be 3.66 people, rounded to 4. Instead we see 11. This means that there's nearly three times as many Christians in cabinet than the average in Singapore.

As for whether this affects the position on 377A, that's an inference that the OP is making. If we want to take a less controversial conclusion though, it can also be reasonably said that the likelihood of Christian influence being the reason for the position on 377A is likely higher when you have an over-representation of Christians in cabinet.

thirteen out of 20 of our ministers are probably anti-LGBT,pingmr,"Okay this still does not really make sense.

You are saying that Joanna was cancelled by a vocal minority, but that there is a silent majority that supports her. However this silent majority is also scared of supporting Joanna because they will also be cancelled by the vocal minority.

You then refer to Trump. Trump actually did not even win the majority vote, Hilary did. So I'm not sure this is a good example of a silent majority, because he did not have majority support. Trump won because he narrowly won in key states and had enough votes in the electoral college. He did not win because he had a silent majority in the united states of america that supported him. 

You then refer to the two petitions. Yeah I know the support 377A petition had twice as many (or more than), however I also know that the repeal petition specifically required your identification to show that you are either a citizen or PR, a requirement that the support petition did not have.

This issue aside though, if the numbers are accurate, there are twice as many ""support 377a"" people than ""repeal 377A"" people, and this majority is certainly not silent they are entirely capable of signing petitions to the Government. If that is the case, why is there even a fear of being cancelled?

The thing I don't get is - either there is majority support for keeping 377A in which case there should be nothing to fear about being cancelled since you are literally giving a view that enjoys popular support, or there isn't, in which case the cancellation concern is valid.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",blanketsevens,"Thanks for your apology. What I find interesting is that while Christians often apologise to queer people for the way the church has mistreated us, I rarely see queer-affirming Christians (visibly) tell the rest of their Christian brethren that their beliefs are incompatible with an inclusive society. Isn't it more important to course-correct than to keep doing damage control?

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",Boogie_p0p,"Hi OP,

First of all, thanks for the apology. I'm one of the people Joanna called satanist/satan-influenced, and while I'm wholly sympathetic about your situation where you were made to feel like an outcast in a place where you should be finding warmth and comfort for your spiritual needs, I absolutely cannot find it in myself to forgive Joanna until she has shown that she's not just paying lip service which your religion is so fond of doing.

The Church as a whole has done many good things but also many bad things - with both types of action being justified by the same book. You see acceptance and love that radiates from the same passages that other people see moral justification for their vile actions. So as much as I want to believe that your version of the ""Truth"" about LGBT is more mainstream than hers, I'm really struggling to believe it is.

I must admit that I'm resentful of your religion and how even moderates like yourself are telling us to be the bigger person and forgive her. Why should we forgive Joanna? She literally called us satanist/satan-influenced. Why are the moderates not publicly rebuking her and standing up to her and say, ""Hey, your kind of rhetoric has no place in society and is antithesis to what Jesus has taught us. You're not Christian."" 

I guess what I'm trying to say is I don't need your apology. I need to see action that shows condemnation of her action from people that she identifies with, cause Lord knows the siege mentality of xtians like hers will only reinforced the idea the Outside World/Agents of Satan are out of get ppl like her.",8,1595729536,26/7/2020 2:12,hi op  first of all thanks for the apology i am one of the people joanna called satanistsataninfluenced and while i am wholly sympathetic about your situation where you were made to feel like an outcast in a place where you should be finding warmth and comfort for your spiritual needs i absolutely cannot find it in myself to forgive joanna until she has shown that she is not just paying lip service which your religion is so fond of doing  the church as a whole has done many good things but also many bad things  with both types of action being justified by the same book you see acceptance and love that radiates from the same passages that other people see moral justification for their vile actions so as much as i want to believe that your version of the truth about lgbt is more mainstream than hers i am really struggling to believe it is  i must admit that i am resentful of your religion and how even moderates like yourself are telling us to be the bigger person and forgive her why should we forgive joanna she literally called us satanistsataninfluenced why are the moderates not publicly rebuking her and standing up to her and say hey your kind of rhetoric has no place in society and is antithesis to what jesus has taught us you are not christian   i guess what i am trying to say is i do not need your apology i need to see action that shows condemnation of her action from people that she identifies with cause lord knows the siege mentality of xtians like hers will only reinforced the idea the outside worldagents of satan are out of get ppl like her,hi op first thanks apology one people joanna called satanistsataninfluenced wholly sympathetic situation made feel like outcast place finding warmth comfort spiritual needs absolutely cannot find forgive joanna shown paying lip service religion fond church whole done many good things also many bad things types action justified book see acceptance love radiates passages people see moral justification vile actions much want believe version truth lgbt mainstream really struggling believe must admit resentful religion even moderates like telling us bigger person forgive forgive joanna literally called us satanistsataninfluenced moderates publicly rebuking standing say hey kind rhetoric place society antithesis jesus taught us christian guess trying say need apology need see action shows condemnation action people identifies cause lord knows siege mentality xtians like reinforced idea outside worldagents satan get ppl like,Neutral,Neutral,hi op first thanks apology one people joanna called satanistsataninfluenced wholly sympathetic situation made feel like outcast place finding warmth comfort spiritual needs absolutely cannot find forgive joanna shown paying lip service religion fond church whole done many good things also many bad things types action justified book see acceptance love radiates passages people see moral justification vile actions much want believe version truth  mainstream really struggling believe must admit resentful religion even moderates like telling us bigger person forgive forgive joanna literally called us satanistsataninfluenced moderates publicly rebuking standing say hey kind rhetoric place society antithesis jesus taught us christian guess trying say need apology need see action shows condemnation action people identifies cause lord knows siege mentality xtians like reinforced idea outside worldagents satan get ppl like

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",Mikeferdy,"I am an ex-muslim atheist. There is no need for you to apologise on behalf of a stranger. You are not directly related to her other than a religious label.

It would be as if a muslim apologising on behalf of Osama Bin Laden.

That said, does your apology hold value? If a Singaporean muslim apologise for the actions of Osama, does it invalidate Osama as an Islamic terrorist?

I have never been a Christian nor get too much involved in Christian culture in Singapore, but I imagine it shares many similarities with Islam, being a middle east mythology v3.0 and v4.0 and all.

The problem is people are basing their decisions, morals and actions based on texts from 2000+ and 600+ years ago respectively. Texts that acts more like a fairy tale than actual historical accounts. And these texts holds specific verses that openly condemn homosexuals.

Christians and Muslims have been persecuting homosexuals for hundreds of years and now in the 2000's, a small relatively new group are claiming that their texts have been misinterpreted for hundreds of years. Do you think this small group holds a candle to the wider Christian/ Muslim community?

The truth is, Christiality and Islam are an anti-LGBT ideology. It is actually the outside acceptances of LGBT groups that forces Christians and Muslims to twist and warp their interpretations in order to keep up with the time. And the more conservatives Christians and Muslims will see this as an attack on their ideology, which technically it is.

The existence of you ""moderates"" are a bit of a headache. You want to have it both ways by having both LGBT acceptance and still accepting your anti-LGBT ideology but just omit out the anti-LGBT parts.

I used to be somewhat borderline theological, but I now feel like modern religion is a caricature of faith instead of actual self reflection and introspection.

Or can one be religious in the confines of one own heart while not approving of the largely toxic communities that surround it?

Also while your modern, more open, less toxic form of Christianity is more socially acceptable than Theng's, what makes you so sure as an individual that her insanity isn't truly the word of god? (Or at least that your reading and intepretation is better/more accurate than hers?)

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",thedailyrant,"Just want to discuss a couple of bits of what you said. 

In my experience with the religious community of Singapore, this is the norm for a huge percentage of the more successful churches here. Even when people are kind, they will still think you are wrong for not following their teaching. Let's not get started on the obvious judgement from the community when you aren't following what they perceive as 'right'.



I straight up disagree. Conservative Christians in Singapore \*do\* promote judgement of others and even suggest those that don't follow their rules will go to hell. Sure, they might not say you're working in league with Satan, but you'll still be punished eternally for not letting Jesus take the wheel.

I can't stress enough that this woman is appalling and should not have a platform of any kind to influence others, so I do applaud your conviction in speaking in this.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",jlswammer,"Personally I didn't manage to watch the vid in time because they took it down? (But if anybody has it can share also lol)

But generally I feel like the whole stand with regards to homophobia or LGBTQ issues is a very difficult tightrope to walk. On one hand the Bible says to love everyone, so yes we have to be accepting, but then also some people use that to say oh ykno so yes we can have LGBTQ because love everyone. And then on the other side there are passages in the bible that are against LGBTQ and homosexuality, so obviously people will use that to counter and say it shouldn't be allowed. 

Although I didn't watch the video (so correct me if I'm wrong) it just seems like they went super hardline against LGBTQ, and also I heard the 666 thing and the flag, that one is quite clearly misinformation/misuse of context or whatever you want to call it. Generally I try to steer clear of commenting on Revelations because its very different from much of the Bible, its very prophetic and there are a lot of things that are mentioned which can seem to make no sense or have no relevance to modern day, even though it is a book for the then-future. And I feel the vague-ness of the scripture can leave it very vulnerable to misinterpretation. Like even normal verses already have debate sometimes, Revelations is just next level. So yea even without watching the video the moment I heard Revelations my first thought was ""yeah this has the potential to go very wrong"" and unfortunately it did.

Personally I'm undecided on where I stand with regards to LGBTQ and Christianity, I don't read that much about it so I'm not very qualified to comment on that. But I will say that the Bible tells you to love everyone, and this means that according people that respect where if they make a decision then you have to respect that. Obviously it has to run according to law too, for example its your choice to steal, even though the bible says its wrong, but the law of the land enforces punishment. So likewise for LGBTQ I guess. 

I think that more important than LGBTQ is the image that Christians are portraying with regards to Jesus and their religion. Maybe I should have put this point a bit higher up so that more people would read zz. For years God has always been seen as somebody who's harsh and unforgiving, when that really isn't true. Like your parents are harsh too, there are certain things they tell you not to do for your own good right? Like don't touch fire or socket, don't anyhow walk in the middle of the road, and these corrections are out of love, for your own security. It's just a pity that many people today view it as overbearing or like tiger mum, also because thats how Christianity was portrayed in the past (which I would like to say is also misinterpretation). Ultimately Christianity is a relationship with God, a God who loves you so much that he sent his son to die for you to save us from sin and evil (if you wish to ask more about this sure private msg me its q a long story). But yea thats what Christianity is, and I feel really sad sometimes when Christians and Christianity are seen to be bigots, especially because some people are like that, either because they don't know any better, they don't understand the Bible or they are ignorant.

Overall I just feel like in general the Christian stand is against LGBTQ, but we should not and cannot let that just blind us into rejecting those who are LGBTQ, because thats not what Jesus did right? He ate with prostitutes, lepers, tax collectors, so who are you to condemn that. Just like how as a parent you may disagree with what your child does, but you still love them and try to provide for them.",4,1595733504,26/7/2020 3:18,personally i did not manage to watch the vid in

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",veryhappyhugs,"Thanks for your kind words. I have a small theory for what you experienced (which is a worse version of mine, but essentially similar): 

Most of the 1st gen Christians in Singapore were largely influenced by American conservative Evangelical preachers. At that time, the fundamentalist-modernist debate in the 20th century still loomed large, and issues like evolution, homosexuality and abortion were hills they were willing to die upon. Elsewhere, the majority of churches (e.g. Catholicism and mainline Protestants) willingly accepted evolution, and these moral issues don't hold as much consensus as the fundamentalists did. 

The issue is that most Christians in Singapore were raised in the fundamentalist bubble, and while there has been much improvement, Singaporean Christians largely see the world through the lenses of American conservative theology/ politics. As someone that reads a good bit, it was easier for me to 'deconvert'. 

I'm still Christian, and I dare say a better brand of Christianity, but it grieves to see so many Christians still behave this way.",32,1595711090,25/7/2020 21:04,thanks for your kind words i have a small theory for what you experienced which is a worse version of mine but essentially similar   most of the  gen christians in singapore were largely influenced by american conservative evangelical preachers at that time the fundamentalistmodernist debate in the  century still loomed large and issues like evolution homosexuality and abortion were hills they were willing to die upon elsewhere the majority of churches eg catholicism and mainline protestants willingly accepted evolution and these moral issues do not hold as much consensus as the fundamentalists did   the issue is that most christians in singapore were raised in the fundamentalist bubble and while there has been much improvement singaporean christians largely see the world through the lenses of american conservative theology politics as someone that reads a good bit it was easier for me to  wouldeconvert   i am still christian and i dare say a better brand of christianity but it grieves to see so many christians still behave this way,thanks kind words small theory experienced worse version mine essentially similar gen christians singapore largely influenced american conservative evangelical preachers time fundamentalistmodernist debate century still loomed large issues like evolution homosexuality abortion hills willing die upon elsewhere majority churches eg catholicism mainline protestants willingly accepted evolution moral issues hold much consensus fundamentalists issue christians singapore raised fundamentalist bubble much improvement singaporean christians largely see world lenses american conservative theology politics someone reads good bit easier wouldeconvert still christian dare say better brand christianity grieves see many christians still behave way,,Neutral,thanks kind words small theory experienced worse version mine essentially similar gen christians singapore largely influenced american conservative evangelical preachers time fundamentalistmodernist debate century still loomed large issues like evolution homosexuality abortion hills willing die upon elsewhere majority churches eg catholicism mainline protestants willingly accepted evolution moral issues hold much consensus fundamentalists issue christians singapore raised fundamentalist bubble much improvement singaporean christians largely see world lenses american conservative theology politics someone reads good bit easier wouldeconvert still christian dare say better brand christianity grieves see many christians still behave way

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",veryhappyhugs,"In many countries, Christians do. I can think of so many in the US: Rachel Held Evans, Jared Byas, Peter Enns just to name a few. These are prominent Evangelicals who do speak out against mistreatment. 

But you are right that Singapore rarely (if ever) does this. Why? Because Singapore is still very conservative, and sometimes when society moves in a more 'liberal' direction, the conservative Christians may retreat further into their fortresses. Very few are like me who are more accepting of sexual minorities.

This is too lenient an assessment that masks over all the underlying fault-lines. As with any religion, Christianity needs to protect itself from radicalization - and presently, there is a small but growing faction whose actions do not meet the standards of a multi-religious society like Singapore, where certain boundaries need to be respected. 

There are certain church leaders who actively propagate homophobia and other exclusive hate messages on the pretext of acting on Godâs will. There are aggressive proselytizers that fail to respect that we all are entitled to our own faiths and beliefs, or having no religious beliefs at all. I have Christian friends that are *supporters* of s 377A - government has already said that the statute is not proactively enforced, so it is one thing to be neutral about it and another to actively advocate for such a systematically repressive law to stay.

So ultimately, we should not trivialize it as ""it's just one person"".

As an ex-Christian and LGBTQ member myself, I am genuinely curious about this. Gathering from both my many years as a Christian and the many interactions I have with current Christians, one phrase seems to always pop up 

""Hate the sin, love the sinner""

Albeit having rather extreme rhetoric, I would go as far as to argue that Joanna has similar views to many Christians, although they disguise their homophobia by actively ignoring parts of their religion to assimilate into modern society.

By how you say ""your religion"", I would assume that you are not yourself a Christian. So if you think that christianity didn't do anything wrong, are you of the opinion that 

Christians can treat active homosexuals as lesser life forms as long as they keep it to themselves?

This is just in response to the existence of such quotes in the Bible.

Leviticus 20:13
If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.
Leviticus 18:22
You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.
1st corinthians 6:9-11
Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
Romans 1:26-27

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",teenylittlebeanie,"i believe youâre referring to the book of romans? the word âhomosexualityâ did not come about until the 1940s. the term âhomosexualityâ in the bible was also vaguely translated. paulâs writing at that time was also largely based on the society he was in then. when the apostle Paul pointed out âhomosexualityâ in the church of Romans, he wasnât referring to a healthy and loving same-sex relationship. the concept of an innate romantic and sexual orientation towards the same sex did not exist in that time period. some jewish texts also mentioned that sex between men was referring to idolatry/ pedophila/ adultery etc. i mean, paul also believed that a womanâs hair has to be kept covered, i donât see us doing it anymore. however, on a broader perspective, i think the book of romans called us all a sinner and that we shouldnât be passing judgement around â where the person judging is considered hypocritical and has also committed as sin as well. hence, paul had also reminded the church that whatever laws there are it only sums up to this: love your neighbour as yourself. 

if homosexuality, a loving and healthy same-sex relationship is considered a sinful nature, then there many other sins that has be brought into the discussion as well. matters like adultery and divorce that were deems as a no-no in paulâs time.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",FiReBrAnDz,"I really appreciate your actions to right a wrong here, but it is my opinion that as the other poster has mentioned that circumstances does not absolve anyone from wrongdoing, an argument which is similar to the arguement ""I was just following orders"". Forgiveness needs to be earned and is not just given, especially in light of a 'non-apology' apology.

I understand that a church community can exert a huge amount of peer pressure as it is a community that a churchgoer grew up with/ or is their main community and it would thus be incredibly difficult to goes against your family(both figuratively and literally). However, to put it simply, your rights end where mine begins, nobody's rights should be infringed upon to make one feel comfortable. Actions that are discriminatory should not be condone in any civil society.


I feel that I do agree with you on certain points(do correct me if I'm misrepresenting your points), the anger and backlash should be directed towards the church and the leaders itself, as it's apparent that their teachings are unsuitable in this society. This is why we shouldn't just forgive and forget, or just make Joanna the scapegoat, as such an event will no doubtedly happen again.


I find the idea of 'not comming from a mainstream church' a similar variant of the ['no true Scotsman' fallacy] and it was due to the centralised nature of the Catholic church that was one of the reasons for the reformation started by Martin Luther.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",dastardy_dood,"
Not OP but one thing i'd like to point out is that few religious people in Singapore are practicing their scriptures/bibles/qurans literally or fundamentally (god created world in 7 days so on and so forth). In fact I'd say that most religions are just cherry-picking parts to follow to ""assimilate into modern society"" as you note. A christian/muslim/hindu in Singapore practice differently from those in USA/ middle east /India (lumping all middle eastern countries into a single block is for rhetoric purposes).

I personally have no gripes as to that, as long as they cherry-pick the parts that generally follow our society's ""rules, as i believe it is impossible to change what people think, nor would it be wise to dictate what a person can think.

I think this makes it really sucky to be an LGBTQ person, so all i can say is to avoid those people, and prevent legislation from being affected by them.

Even as they try to twist the discussion into morality, its best to discuss about the civil rights to divorce legislation from their self-proclaimed moral superiority.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",syanda,"As a Christian myself, I think I can explain it in a nutshell. Sin's a big part of religion, and especially Christianity. Sinning is a big no-no. There's a whole bunch of things listed as sins, and unfortunately, homosexuality has been commonly interpreted as one of them - so to be a good Christian, technically you can't be sinning or approve of sin.

But that entire thing is supposed to be subordinated by the goddamned commandments - of which the first is to love God, and the second is to *love thy neighbour as thyself*. Which means it's fundamentally un-Christian to treat a fellow human being badly, say, by systematically denying them the same rights you enjoy, or treating them as subhuman - which is unfortunately, the things that LGBTQ individuals do suffer in Singapore.

Unfortunately, an all too significan't number of Christians and churches here have drunk the kool aid of fundamentalist Christianity exported here, especially by the big megachurches or popular Christian movements from overseas - where LGBTQ becomes a convenient target (among others) for fundie adherents to compare themselves to, denounce, and fell godly and good.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",peipakao,"Christian here. I've heard it said that a good rule of thumb to follow is that any OT rule that is specifically *reinforced* in the New Testament (NT) will still apply. Otherwise, as has been pointed out below, things like food laws and other laws relating to ritual purity (as opposed to moral laws) have been abrogated. So yes, enjoy your pork, chilli crab, and clothing made of more than 1 material.

However, the problem is that the prohibition against homosexuality is indeed specifically reinforced in the NT (found in multiple places such as the Pauline letters). So it's very hard to get around that unless you pick and choose your theology.

It should also be pointed out that at the time which most of the New Testament was written, the Roman Empire was the dominant power. If I'm not wrong (please correct me if I am), homosexuality was accepted to some degree in Greco-Roman society. While Christianity did originate with the Jews, whose religion already did prohibit homosexuality, it soon spread to include non-Jews (Gentiles), and the early church authorities decided that Gentiles would not be required to obey the laws of Judaism (Acts 15). However, the prohibition against homosexuality still remained, although Gentiles quickly started to form the majority of Christians. 

On the other hand, it has been argued that the continued condemnation of homosexuality was targeted at pederastic (man/ boy) relationships, and was not a blanket condemnation of homosexuality or non-heterosexuality in general. I'm no expert or scholar, so I don't have an opinion as to whether this is a good argument, although I find it a bit hard to believe.

Tl;dr there are lots of OT laws but most of the ones dealing with ritual purity, e.g. food laws, have been abrogated. However, the prohibition against homosexuality, originally found in Judaism, continued to be enforced by Christianity, even as it began to distinguish itself from Judaism and explicitly not enforce most of Judaism's laws -

I'd slightly disagree with you on this :) Christians not reading the Bible literally does not imply that they are cherry-picking. The Bible is ancient literature, and it does not comport with modern categories of 'literal' or 'metaphor'. E.g. the book of Job is a theodicy and a poem, it can be taken as history or merely as poetic narrative, but if we go down this rabbit whole of deciding which is which, we'd miss the point of the genre.

So e.g. the world is created in 7 days relies on a literal historical reading of the text, but this would miss out the rich structural characteristics of the text, the Ancient Near Eastern cosmology, the theological function of the text. Indeed, I'd say Genesis is more a *polemic* of ancient religions than a literal history of mankind. So you see, the right reading of the text isn't necessarily literal.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",thefibrobee,"It was from finally getting diagnosed with a chronic invisible^ illness but instead of receiving support while I tried to not get depressed/angry with my world getting turned upside down by my ill health, I just kept feeling excluded, repeatedly told directly and indirectly that I need to âhave more faithâ and I will be healed (I really tried and spent more than a year going for lots and lots of healing sessions and expensive conferences etc). 

With the help of psychological therapy I began to accept what was going on with my body and also in terms of faith and healing, I accepted that God has put me on this path for a greater reason and for His greater glory than just healing me, and I stopped going up to be prayed for healing, and so on, and told friends and pastors that we can agree to disagree on this matter. But as I continued to stay in the church, I began to see that more and more I could no longer relate to church programmes and sermons anymore cos my life was not the ordinary married/ soon-to-be-married/ single-but-looking person who has/will have a couple kids, has a promising career (or a spouse who does), etc which the programmes and sermons are catered towards. 

Friends in church also started drifting apart, even in cell group I could see that people were tired of hearing about my week yet again being about me just trying to live while trying to manage my health. I too was getting tired of having to answer the endless âhow are you, are you getting better-oh still the same ah aiyoh-okay how can I pray for youâ rhetoric. Oftentimes I just wished I could just reply

And so I just gradually drifted out the church and now keep my fellowship with regular checking in via texts and meetups with just a couple of friends who are able to understand my situation, who donât say any of the above hurtful/âexcludingâ comments. And thatâs from someone who used to be in several different circles of friends just within church alone. Quality > quantity, this Iâve learnt. ??

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",deangsana,"I give you the following source texts that the Leviticus Old Testament laws were indeed superseded: Mark 7:1-23 (ceremonial washing and food laws abolished), Romans 4:1-12 (circumcision abolished), and Acts 15:1-22 (all Leviticus laws **except** consumption of blood, idolatry and sexual immorality abolished).

Actually Matthew 5:17 is also one of them. Essentially the Leviticus laws were only intended for the Jews. They were moral laws encoded into practice, and also were an outward sign that the nation of Israel was set apart from the other nations at that time for God's purposes.

What Jesus emphasized in Mark 7:1-23 is that what is more important is upholding the moral spirit of the law rather than performing the letter of the law, he spent most of his public ministry calling out the hypocrisy of the religious Jews of the day because of this.

In fact, I encourage you to read on after the Mattthew 5:17 passage you quoted, Jesus' standard of morality exceeds that the Leviticus laws. Anger is equivalent to Murder, Lust is equivalent to Adultery. What it means when Jesus ""fulfilled the law"", he was the only one who was able to embody the full set of moral law perfectly.

Actually the whole point of Christianity is that as imperfect beings we cannot fulfill God's standards by ourselves. The penalty of sin is death, and eternal separation from God. Christ, the perfect Son of God paid the penalty on our behalf, and it is the faith in Christ as our substitute that makes us acceptable before God, not the performance of laws:

Therefore, I believe that we Christians should not be imposing our morality on society, because if one does not believe, there is no relationship with God. We need to persuade others to believe in Christ first before our morality applies to them. Too often it gets reversed, acceptable sins in the Church is ignored and excused while the sins outside the Church are judged. This is emphasized in 1 Corinthians 5:

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",deangsana,"In my other [comment] I have outlined that Christians do not have to obey the Levitical laws to the text, but we obey it in its spirit, read in context of Christ's fulfillment in the New Testament. 

Nevertheless, I think it is clear throughout the whole OT and NT that the only acceptable expression of human sexuality is in a monogamous, consensual, heterosexual relationship in the confines of a marriage. But it is not a requirement for a person to have a change in sexual desire to be acceptable to God. Marriage and sexuality has been given special significance in the bible but it still not fundamental to the human experience, on the contrary, one's relationship with God is fundamental. Marriage and sexuality is only a foreshadow of the glorious reality of Heaven when we are reunited with God, so a Christian can live a fulfilled single life because of this promise. I fully understand that this sounds ridiculous to non-Christians and even as a single person myself it is hard to believe in, but its part and parcel of setting aside earthly desires and focusing on the eternal.

Even so, elaborating on my my aforementioned comment, Christians should not expect the wider society to conform to our standards of morality, because they have not accepted the premises of Christianity in the first place. In fact my previous paragraph sounds absolutely ridiculous because most Christians still tend to focus on this material life and the selective opposition to LGBT is a symptom of this, I think part of the motivation for this is to make their own life easier within their own bubble.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",deadlyfaithdawn,"Look, I know where you come from and I've heard variations of what you've said hundreds of times by now. 


In relation to the rich portion, nobody is campaigning for it because there was *no resistance to the notion at all* even though it is explicitly said in the book. The push came eons ago, and amazingly, zero pushback and now it's ""accepted"". People now are pushing for the right to love as they wish, and yet this represents an unacceptable desecration of the texts? 


Honestly to me, what the whole situation sounds closest like is an abusive relationship, where the battered spouse who is beaten (persecuted) somehow convinces himself /herself that the beater ""loves me"", ""is doing this for my good"", ""had no choice cause I deserved it"", that all the battered spouse has to do is to ""have faith, stop questioning and do better"". 


Whatever the case is, I acknowledge that some Christians truly believe in the word of God, and I respect their right to hold whatever beliefs they have, regardless of what I may personally think of it. I wouldn't even ask/convince them of anything because that's their personal beliefs and I think that everyone is entitled to that. 


But what we're seeing here is when people try to impose their beliefs onto others. When people try to demonize or outlaw LGBT relationship because of ""their personal truths"". When people try to implement their belief onto a general populace which may not subscribe to their faith or beliefs.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",veryhappyhugs,"Thank you for sharing your painful struggles in the midst of a church which did not love you as they should.

There is a trend towards faith healing that, while I believe to be possible through the Spirit, ultimately, I also know that God does not heal everyone. There are amazing Christians (you included) who are so-called 'disabled', but I always remind myself of this amazing passage in John 9:


It is saddening to see Christians excluding you and failing to see that God has a plan for displaying his glory through your life. And they are missing out on that. Press on my friend!

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",null_username,"Essentially the laws were intended for the Jews. In fact it is what that gave them their identity. I understand that the laws are said to be abolished in the NT. What makes of the jews who did not accept this narrative? Are they the losers in the end after up-keeping what they hold so sacred even under the greco-roman empire, after being dispersed by the babylonians and most of them not even able to speak their native tongue (hebrew) and had to rely on koine-greek translated texts (otherwise known as the Septuagint) for their book of faith (judaism).

I know that the typical christian answer will be that their hearts are hardened, but that is only said in the NT narrative which is bias. It seems to me that the jews are being made to look like fools for not accepting christianity and will result in going to hell at the end of the day after thousand of years of holding on to the covenant made at Mt Sinai. In the christian narrative, it seems like God played hide and seek with the Jews only to say that whatever He told them to keep throughout their generations is not really what He meant all this while. 

There is some things christians lack to understand. During Jesus time, the actions and words of Jesus narrated in the 4 gospels are radical and you will literally be stoned to death for uttering those words. Also the term pharisee is misused a lot. It seems that in church preaching, it is a derogatory term thrown to religious jews, creating this false impression that the jews were blinded in keeping their laws. Pharisees simply meant an jew who observe his/her written and oral law. This obviously meant that the pharisees are learned people who can read and write at least in greek or aramic and maybe some hebrew. Of course not the entire jewish population are able to have such literacy. This will natural draw a separation between those who are able to observe their law as they are literate and those who are not. Surely the pharisees can be called to be hypocrites as keeping 613 laws is pretty insane. And that was why Jesus was favoured by the other Jews who were not as literate, and not the pharisees, take a look at the twelve disciples for instance. 

In fact Jesus is a pharisee himself. I know it sounds strange but that is due to the christian preaching of tying hypocrisy and pharisee together. Just that the Jesus we know in the NT is radical and claims to be God which no observing jews will ever dare of doing that. I get that the NT wants to market that a new age of covenant is being issued. But in the spirit of discussing such topics, we have to look into things without any bias whatsoever. Whatever the NT says about what Jesus said is not 100% indisputable. For all we know the Jesus that existed isnât the same Jesus narrated in the 4 gospels.

Christianity main message is the gospel of Jesus death on the cross paying for all mankind sin if anyone believes in him. (paraphrase from famous john 3:16). And what comes after is to live a life like how Jesus did during his 33 years on earth. 

Of course there is a concept of evangelism introduces in Book of Matthew great commission (chapter 28 iirc). Evangelism surely is a foreign concept to Judaism. If you tell an orthodox Rabbi that you wish to convert to a jew, he will surely tell you to not to as there is no need. He will even go further to convince you that itâs not worth it as you will have to keep 613 laws after. There is no difference to a gentile and a jew in the afterlife in Judaism. Even the concept of eternal hell is foreign to judaism. Clearly there have been ancient greek influence in christianity like hell to hades, trinity to zeus, poseidon, hades and even the concept of demigod where a deity will come down to impregnate women. 

There are in fact a lot of dependencies in the christian narrative to me. Hence is why i always advise my christian friends to not loosely swing their belief and impose to others. There are better ways to evangelise than what City Revival did in this case. There needs to be a mutual understanding from both ends. How much does a christian understand someone who is LGBTQ? vice versa how much does someone who is LGBTQ understand where a believing in good faith christian is coming from?

Based on what I see, people who are LGTBQ have been hurt by the way vocal christians evangelise without even taking a first step to understand their struggles and problems. Surely Jesus will have taken a more compassionate approach towards such a vulnerable community in society.
I hope christians can take this as an advise when evangelising. They have to understand that even though they had found their salvation and hope, others of other faith/belief have their own personal hope/salvation. Take it from an ex christian who did evangelised tactfully and who have close friends in the LGBTQ community. It is not about hating the act but still loving the person. It is about understanding and putting yourself into the shoes of others. Honestly it was an eye opener to me when I left the faith, that I came to understand the animosity of non christians towards christians who try to impose their beliefs unto others.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",thefibrobee,"And yes I do hope that churches will start seeing that they canât just cater to the majority âhappy stable lifeâ people and leave the minority out. Many such people end up feeling so left out they just leave the church (and sometimes their faith too) altogether, which is sad.

Though Iâve also reached a point where I no longer agree with how most churches here are run in such corporate ways and oftentimes a lot of money is used for things that are just for looks. 

I quite like what Ps Francis Chan (author of bestseller book Crazy Love) did. He left his own megachurch he founded, to start a church-planting network called We Are Church. 


In a way itâs going back to basics like the house churches in the New Testament. Or essentially just cell groups.

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",deangsana,"Hi thanks for your comments, you make a lot of points, I will try to cover as much as I can, thanks for your time in reading this wall of text:

In the Christian narrative Judaism was proto-Christianity. They were the privileged nation that God chose to reveal himself first to. The law was God's moral standard and it revealed that no one is able attain it, necessitating temple sacrifice that represents Christ, and were told to look forward to the Messiah (Christ) that would come from the line of David. Through keeping faith in the promised Messiah the Jews were saved, in the Christian sense. In fact, there were Gentiles (non Jews) before the time of Christ who were saved in the same way. The nation of Israel was supposed to be the representative of God to the nations.

Some Jews that were well versed in the Law at the time of Jesus could recognize him as the Messiah and believed. However most of them could not accept Jesus because they were hoping for a conquering political leader that would overthrow the Romans and not the suffering servant prophesied in Isaiah 53. Don't think its best to use Pharisee as a derogatory term, because if any Christian is honest, we are often trust in our own efforts rather than God as well. Till this day the Jews are still waiting for the Messiah, but there is a growing movement of Messianic Jews who realize that Jesus is the one who they have been waiting for all this time.

In the OT Hell was called Sheol. Maybe there was Greek influence, and some say Judaism is Neo-Mesopotamian religion. But maybe that's how God spoke. This can be a controversial topic. And regarding the NT Jesus, there are many ancient copies of scripture found by archaeologists and they all corroborate well towards one narrative, few ancient text can match up to the level of archaeological evidence that we have for the Bible.

Yes I do agree that evangelism needs to be done in a tactful manner, my church emphasizes on relational and persuasive evangelism done in an authentic manner, much like what you have described, but doing this requires a lot of effort and empathy. Unfortunately a lot of churches here promote a form of easy, feel good-Christianity and they don't promote Biblical Literacy - which is time consuming and makes leaders job harder - so to make up for the lack of knowledge and conviction they turn to group identity and conspiracy lite tactics, which unfortunately results in videos like this",3,1595765867,26/7/2020 12:17,hi thanks for your comments

"As a Christian, I need to apologize for Joanna Theng's ""apology""",null_username,"Thanks for your in depth reply. You made an interesting point saying through keeping faith in the promised Messiah the Jews were saved. Do you mean that the Jews are saved from hell (eternal suffering and condemnation) if the keep faith in the promised Messiah before Jesus came and died on the cross? 
It will be great if there are some examples of which Jews that were well versed in the Law at the time that recognize Jesus as the promised messiah and believed. The Jews no doubt expected some one to deliver them out of the Roman empire. After all the term messiah means deliverer. 
Regarding Isaiah 53, it is a very controversial chapter in the bible. Some say that if you read from Isaiah 49:3, it says ""Thou art My servant, Israel, in whom I will be glorified"", in a sense the suffering servant refers to the nation Israel. But let's leave that chapter out of this discussion since it has been heavily debated upon. 
From the past sermons I have attended, pharisee seems to be used in a negative light to associate with hypocrisy. 
I researched and found that Sheol was translated into the word Hades around 200BC when Hebrew scriptures were translated to Greek. During the second temple period the definition of Sheol was a home for the dead wicked Prior the second temple, Sheol is a place of ""silence"" to which all humans go. However, during, or before, the exile in Babylon ideas of activity of the dead in Sheol began to enter Judaism . What I am curious about is why wasn't it made clear to the Israelite at Mt Sinai that if they did not keep their faith, they will be sent to hell and have eternal suffering. 
I am glad to head that your church emphasizes on evangelizing in a authentic ,tactful manner. So far I have only encountered one church that does that sincerely. It is a shame that many other churches promotes a fell good Christianity like what you said. Almost as if needing to meet a certain KPI of attendees or membership. This in turn indirectly discredit good churches like yours. 
Sadly most of the topics in our discussion are controversial and most probably there are many similar discussions out there so there isn't much of a point to go down the rabbit hole unless we are both professional historians /archaeologists/ religious scholars.

the jews were saved do you mean that the jews are saved from hell eternal suffering and condemnation if the keep faith in the promised messiah before jesus came and died on the cross  it will be great if there are some examples of which jews that were well versed in the law at the time that recognize jesus as the promised messiah and believed the jews no doubt expected some one to deliver them out of the roman empire after all the term messiah means deliverer  regarding isaiah  it is a very controversial chapter in the bible some say that if you read from isaiah  it says thou art my servant israel in whom i will be glorified in a sense the suffering servant refers to the nation israel but let us leave that chapter out of this discussion since it has been heavily debated upon  from the

Future of LGBT community in Singapore,power_gust,"My class rep in poly was an openly gay person back even in the 2000s before all the LGBT movement in SG. He wore boots and makeup to school, was neither shy nor apologetic about being gay in school. There was a lot of teasing from people, given how immature our age group was. Our class guys initially bullied him cause he always say he has a crush on someone in my group. Whenever we teased him, he would clap back at us by being an unapologetic queen.

We later became really cool with him and when we had class chalet, we would ask him about his lifestyle and share his thoughts with us. We learned a lot and came to respect him more. Despite not giving a shit about how people think of him, the biggest hurdle is his own family. Acceptance from others was not something he sought, but he couldn't bring himself to let his parents know. We also don't know how he hid it so well, since he's quite flamboyant.

At the same time, I also had a good friend then who hung out with my group here and there, really cool and good looking guy, who one day while we were chatting over MSN, told me that he's bisexual and if I'm ok. I'm definitely cool with it, but he was really hesitant and I think it took a bit of courage from him telling me cause it might lose our friendship if I turned out to be an arse. Thinking back, if I stopped being a friend due to this, then I don't deserve his friendship and it's for the best he found out.

When I was in NS, one of my men came to tell me he's gay. Being from mono-intake, he didn't know if other people will accept him if they found out. I told him if anyone picked on him or he found out someone is talking behind his back, let me know and I will talk to them. Turns out, almost everyone in the platoon is fucking cool with it. He was one of the top few soldiers in the platoon.

Based on my own experience, I think generally people in SG need time to understand and are cool with others' preferences. I honestly find most gay and bisexual people I know to be really good, nice, and genuine people. IMO, the perception towards LGBT in Singapore is getting more recognised as compared to a decade ago when my gay and bisexual friend came out.

Future of LGBT community in Singapore,btcprox,"I feel like maybe there has to be more pressure from both external and internal sources to show just what Singapore loses out on from not rectifying discriminatory policy. In particular, a few (out of multiple) possible ways:

* Successful international corporations that are also strong LGBTQ+ allies, refuse to conduct business with Singapore, instead opting to other friendlier Asian locations
* International figureheads (activists, celebrities, artists, etc.) call out Singapore on LGBTQ+ discrimination
* Internationally successful LGBTQ+ Singaporeans come out to the public, possibly even becoming citizens of other friendlier countries on the grounds of being able to live the lives they want to lead

Appealing to the economic angle might be lacking in the common discussion around LGBTQ+ issues. Most of the time there is appeal made to empathy (emotional anecdotes), but maybe showing that discrimination can actually make Singapore substantially lose out in global appeal /competitiveness might be more convincing.

I'm actually doubtful that this could pass after a generation, because certain religious institutions can still instill the ideas of LGBTQ+ discrimination to newer devotees.

Future of LGBT community in Singapore,A_Watchful_Voyeur,"

I think LGBT community in Singapore are out of touch with the reality. Many of the anti-LGBT people are not even religious or subscribed to Abrahamic religion.

Framing abrahamic religion as the sole origin of anti-LGBT stance is a narrative that the western LGBT-group trying to promote. It is a convenient way to explained why there is anti-LGBT sentiment in the west since abrahic religion is their major contributing factor but it is pure intellectual laziness to paint the entire anti-LGBT sentiment the same way.

Furthermore, marriage is kind of a tricky situation for transpeople who have not undergone SRS as seen in one of the case that occurred a few years ago.

How is the LGBT+ acceptance in Singapore ?,cakeday173,"Generally, PDA is frowned upon here, be it homosexual or heterosexual. So you will get some stares if you kiss, although probably more than if you were not LGBT+. You probably won't be arrested here, but be prepared for a Karen or two acting disrespectfully towards you.

The law on same-sex intercourse is not actively enforced, but if someone were to report you, the law is still on the books. The latest statistics I could find say that in 2006, 7 people were charged. Society is becoming more progressive as of late, but I'd still recommend you to do your business in private.

What I've written above is a general overview of the Singaporean society's views on LGBT+. You'll probably find more support in the more cosmopolitan, expat-majority areas, as well as among those aged 18-25 (the latest statistics from 2019 show about half considered it to be at least 'not wrong most of the time', up from about 20% in 2013 - this may increase by the time covid has ended)",36,1609206602,29/12/2020 1:50,generally pda is frowned upon here be it homosexual or heterosexual so you will get some stares if you kiss although probably more than if you were not lgbt you probably will not be arrested here but be prepared for a karen or two acting disrespectfully towards you  the law on samesex intercourse is not actively enforced but if someone were to report you the law is still on the books the latest statistics i could find say that in   people were charged society is becoming more progressive as of late but i would still recommend you to do your business in private  what i have written above is a general overview of the singaporean society is views on lgbt you will probably find more support in the more cosmopolitan expatmajority areas as well as among those aged  the latest statistics from  show about half considered it to be at least not wrong most of the time up from about  in   this may increase by the time covid has ended,generally pda frowned upon homosexual heterosexual get stares kiss although probably lgbt probably arrested prepared karen two acting disrespectfully towards law samesex intercourse actively enforced someone report law still books latest statistics could find say people charged society becoming progressive late would still recommend business private written general overview singaporean society views lgbt probably find support cosmopolitan expatmajority areas well among aged latest statistics show half considered least wrong time may increase time covid ended,,Neutral,generally pda frowned upon homosexual heterosexual get stares kiss although probably  probably arrested prepared karen two acting disrespectfully towards law samesex intercourse actively enforced someone report law still books latest statistics could find say people charged society becoming progressive late would still recommend business private written general overview singaporean society views  probably find support cosmopolitan expatmajority areas well among aged latest statistics show half considered least wrong time may increase time covid ended

How is the LGBT+ acceptance in Singapore ?,xuanchiao,"Culturally, most elderly will frown at homosexuality, either due to religious beliefs, the norm, peer pressure or otherwise. Many young people I know respect and support LGBT+, but I've encountered my fair share of homophobic teens. They are not so vocal about it though. 

If you PDA in public, people will stare but they won't outright lecture you because people don't really barge into other's businesses here. You won't be arrested and bad looks per say, but if you might encounter that old person who will yell at you in those old neighbourhood.

There are communities such as PinkDot where people fight for rights of LGBT, but it's likely not going to change laws anytime soon due to the deep-rooted belief of having a ""nuclear family"" being the best. For 18 years I have lived I have seen like 3 separate petitions of removing 377a, and nothing happens LMAO.

377a (which makes it illegal for 2 males to have sexual intercourse) is a law, but cases of conviction and punishment is rare since you do it in private and hopefully no one reports you.

"""The price of being queer in Singapore // LGBT Rights in Singapore""",potatomaster420,"To me it's about treating everyone equally. The past 50 and more years have been about fostering cohesion between people with differences in race, language, and religion. Sexual orientation, much like race, is not something to be chosen. Heck, if I could, why would I not select the option that would make life easiest for me? Why would I want to live a life of discrimination and unorthodoxy? So why should someone who has no power over this characteristic have to be disadvantaged or suffer for it? Because I am no less human and no less incapable of empathy and productivity than the next man in line. Besides, the argument that children being exposed to homosexuality as a 'lifestyle' is complete bollocks. No properly straight person would choose to marry someone they are incapable of loving romantically (that is, someone of the same sex). Similarly, no homosexual person with self-interest would decide to play the game of life against their own welfare and commit themselves to a life with someone they cannot love. Or rather, they should not be forcing themselves to do this. So in the end by not recognising the union between gay couples, by denying them the legal benefits (or rights, rather) of marriage, there really is nothing gained, and you lose out on a whole lot of people being happy. Our government's always had such a big emphasis on equality. In race, in religion, in education.

They would be in school uniform. If these are trans girls transitioning at that age, they would also look like any other girl - kids are more or less androgynous until they hit puberty - so it should go unnoticed if the school is understanding and keep it private.

As it is, trans girls in secondary school and JC usually don't mind wearing the boy's school uniform, since pants are unisex. It's hair length that's the issue, and they're often badly bullied by classmates and teachers for being trans or feminine, which may cause them to drop out if they can't take it. When it comes to uniform, the problem is more for trans boys being forced to wear the girls' uniform even if they have started medically transitioning and look and sound male, while banned from using either the male or female toilets (they need to go to the rare unisex ones available). It's also led to quite a few of them dropping out of school - including some promising students from elite schools - rather than deal with that daily humiliation and harassment.

The problem is bad enough that some of us (I'm with TransgenderSG) have considered setting up an alternate school or study group for trans students who drop out, so they can have volunteer tutors come in to train them to take the O and A levels as private candidates. But the logistics are pretty daunting (especially since they're all doing different subjects) and we don't have the funding for it.

It sucks though.

Going by this logic, let's see who else ""deserve it"".

\- People who choose to adopt other people's children.

\- Singles who choose not to marry.

\- Heterosexual couples who choose not to have children.

\- Heterosexual couples who choose to use ARTIFICIAL contraceptive to have fewer children.

\- Heterosexual couples who choose to use any form of fertility aid, e.g. IVF.

All of the above are ""unnatural"" choices. My estimate is that more than 90% of Singaporeans ""deserve it"". Do all of them ""deserve it""?

Anyway, you are wrong. Homosexual is not a choice. It's a desire. Being a desire means that there is some but not complete control of it. For example, a heterosexual person can control his desire not to be sexually aroused in certain situation, often with great concentration. But the desire is still present.

The effect doesnât hold for older or younger sisters, younger brothers, or even for adoptive brothers or stepbrothers.

According to Ray Blanchard, a psychiatry professor at the University of Toronto, the reason could be that the motherâs body mounts an immune attack on the fetus of her unborn son. As the report authors explain:

Male fetuses carry male-specific proteins on their Y chromosome, called H-Y antigens. Blanchard hypothesized that some of these antigens promote the development of heterosexual orientation in males â¦ Because these H-Y antigens are not present in the motherâs body, they trigger the production of maternal antibodies. These antibodies bind to the H-Y antigens and prevent them from functioning.

**1. Supporting gay rights just means eventually taking away benefits from heterosexual couples**

Gay marriage would mean the ability to purchase BTO for HDB flats and deny heterosexual couples some changes at BTO-ing. Also, gay couples most likely will be Dual Income No Kids unless they adopt which means a upward inflationary spiral for resale flats once there exists a mechanism for them to have shared ownership of the flat.

**2. Gay couples don't contribute to replacement rate, legalizing it would just worsen the aging population problem**

Don't ask me the logic behind this since gay people wouldn't have kids anyway or might just get a beard or show-spouse and have kids but in that case there is no difference. But I guess it could apply to bisexual people by ""forcing"" them to be in favour of heterosexual relationships and contribute to replacement rate.

**3. Slippery slope arguments like first gay marriage, next gendered pronouns**

Personally I think this American gender pronoun thing is complete utter bullshit and I'm not calling you Zhe/zer whatever. But there is a fear amongst conservatives that the abolishing of laws against gay marriage is the first step in the liberalization of our laws to the extreme left.

P.S. if you want to understand the point of views of people who don't share your beliefs, it's really easy, just don't block everyone on Facebook who doesn't share the same opinion as you (unless they are some conspiracy theorist of course, those aren't worth even discussing with).",12,1606133372,23/11/2020 12:09,so i support gay rights especially gay marriage so that gay couples can list their so as a next of kin medical emergencies insurance etc but i can share with you what some of my more conservative good friends have told me   supporting gay rights just means eventually taking away benefits from heterosexual couples  gay marriage would mean the ability to purchase bto for hdb flats and deny heterosexual couples some changes at btoing also gay couples most likely will be dual income no kids unless they adopt which means a upward inflationary spiral for resale flats once there exists a mechanism for them to have shared ownership of the flat   gay couples do not contribute to replacement rate legalizing it would just worsen the aging population problem  do not ask me the logic behind this since gay people would not have kids anyway or might just get a beard or showspouse and have kids but in that case there is no difference but i guess it could apply to bisexual people by forcing them to be in favour of heterosexual relationships and contribute to replacement rate   slippery slope arguments like first gay marriage next gendered pronouns  personally i think this american gender pronoun thing is complete utter bullshit and i am not calling you zhezer whatever but there is a fear amongst conservatives that the abolishing of laws against gay marriage is the first step in the liberalization of our laws to the extreme left  ps if you want to understand the point of views of people who do not share your beliefs it is really easy just do not block everyone on facebook who does not share the same opinion as you unless they are some conspiracy theorist of course those are not worth even discussing with,support gay rights especially gay marriage gay couples list next kin medical emergencies insurance etc share conservative good friends told supporting gay rights means eventually taking away benefits heterosexual couples gay marriage would mean ability purchase bto hdb flats deny heterosexual couples changes btoing also gay couples likely dual income kids unless adopt means upward inflationary spiral resale flats exists mechanism shared ownership flat gay couples contribute replacement rate legalizing would worsen aging population problem ask logic behind since gay people would kids anyway might get beard showspouse kids case difference guess could apply bisexual people forcing favour heterosexual relationships contribute replacement rate slippery slope arguments like first gay marriage next gendered pronouns personally think american gender pronoun thing complete utter bullshit calling zhezer whatever fear amongst conservatives abolishing laws gay marriage first step liberalization laws extreme left ps want understand point views people share beliefs really easy block everyone facebook share opinion unless conspiracy theorist course worth even discussing,,Neutral,support gay rights especially gay marriage gay couples list next kin medical emergencies insurance etc share conservative good friends told supporting gay rights means eventually taking away benefits heterosexual couples gay marriage would mean ability purchase bto hdb flats deny heterosexual couples changes btoing also gay couples likely dual income kids unless adopt means upward inflationary spiral resale flats exists mechanism shared ownership flat gay couples contribute replacement rate legalizing would worsen aging population problem ask logic behind since gay people would kids anyway might get beard showspouse kids case difference guess could apply bisexual people forcing favour heterosexual relationships contribute replacement rate slippery slope arguments like first gay marriage next gendered pronouns personally think american gender pronoun thing complete utter bullshit calling zhezer whatever fear amongst conservatives abolishing laws gay marriage first step liberalization laws extreme left ps want understand point views people share beliefs really easy block everyone facebook share opinion unless conspiracy theorist course worth even discussing

"Why do you support 377A / Do not believe that gay rights should be allowed locally? Do you think Singaporeans are generally homophobic, esp online and why so?",LaZZyBird,"Depends on your morals. 

Mind you that you grew up in a liberal Singapore where the internet has exposed you to cultures with a stronger sense of individual liberty (i.e America, Europe etc.). That has primed you to be more accepting, to the point where you think it is natural. 

Your parents grew up in an environment that is different. Singapore back in the day was not some liberal hotbed. Most of them grew up in an environment where homosexuality is at best an oddity, at worse a straight ticket to hell. That primed them to accept the rule the homosexuality is wrong or abhorrent. 

What is right or wrong is a matter of what society decides it is (if you are a moral relativist). Of course, there are some who think it is a matter of natural law, while others believe it is morally abhorrent.

"Why do you support 377A / Do not believe that gay rights should be allowed locally? Do you think Singaporeans are generally homophobic, esp online and why so?",saintpai,"I am neither strongly for, nor strongly against 377A, although sometimes I do find the antics of the most vocal segments of the anti-377A / LGBT rights crowd irksome. 

There is a very old debate about morality in the law in which some have argued that the sole purpose of certain laws was to enforce society's morality. Laws making incest, beastiality, and homosexual sex between men illegal were seen as laws whose sole purpose was to outlaw an act which society deems immoral. 

The contention then is that if we say that laws can never be there simply to enforce morality (and therefore a law like 377A is never justified), then what right do we have to say that incest is illegal, given that the only reason why incest is outlawed is because society deems the act of incest to be immoral (personally, I would be hard pressed to come up with utilitarian arguments against incest). Thus, we have a fairly strong argument that some form of morality in the law is permissible, and cannot simply brush aside legislation against homosexual sex as unjust or unjustified because ""the law must never enforce morality"".

Of course, this assumes that homosexual sex falls within the realm of immorality just as incest and beastiality do. Undoubtedly, societal attitudes towards homosexual sex have undergone a sea change, and most people on this reddit would argue that homosexual sex is in no way immoral. But then again, the morality (or immorality) of homosexual sex is itself such a complicated argument. Those with religious leanings would argue for immorality based on their religious teachings, while others simply fail to see why a penis penetrating a (male) anus is any less moral than a penis penetrating a vagina. Who's to say who is right? 

One possible ""third path"" might be that while homosexual sex (and incest, and beastiality) may not necessarily be immoral (especially given evolving societal standards) they do, at the very least, amount to deviant behaviour in some form or another. That being the case, laws discouraging such tendencies may well be justifiable. Those who argue in this manner recognise that homosexual sex may not be immoral, and this manner of reasoning skirts the great controversy about the morality of gay sex, while maintaining a gateway for a similar form of logic to be applied: ""law justified where law discourages deviant behaviour"" (instead of the former ""law justified where law outlaws immoral act"").

"Why do you support 377A / Do not believe that gay rights should be allowed locally? Do you think Singaporeans are generally homophobic, esp online and why so?",Wheat-gen-stein,"If you're looking for such stances, it would be hard to find it here on reddit singapore. Maybe try EDMW? 

But to play devil's advocate, one reason that I do find plausible to reject full marriage rights for gay couples is housing. Not that I support this view. Take these few facts:

1. Heterosexual couples are more likely to have children than homosexual couples if they both have their own home. 

2. The introduction of homosexual couples eligible for BTOs will reduce the number of BTOs for het couples.

3. Therefore, on a population-level, TFR will be reduced if homosexual couples are given equal marriage rights. 

Now, there are many ways to avoid the conclusion (3). Such as enshrining gay marriages as unions that do not have the same housing benefits. Or just pumping out more BTOs. 

And some might argue that some heterosexuals still remain childless even if given BTOs, so its unfair to homosexual couples. This is true, but we are looking at likelihoods, not certainties. Its like different standards for NAPFA or IPPT by gender. Some will argue ""but there are some women who are more fit than men, therefore, women should not have an easier IPPT"". Yes, that is true, but when we look at policies, we must look at statistical likelihoods, rather than individual exceptions.

And the government response could well possibly be to say ""okay, then BTO subsidies will only be for couples who eventually have children, be it if you are a gay or straight couple"". Which, tbh, at this point with our abysmal TFR, I would not really oppose, even when I don't expect to have children too. 

I do not find any other arguments plausible, except for the TFR argument.

Edit: To add, while I do find this argument plausible, I think the main defeater is simply that we could simply pump out more BTOs.

Thats a very unique point of view! However, I would say that though morals are subjective, and they play a part in setting the law, incest is never the same as gay relationships.

Incest leads to the accumulation of recessive alleles in the offsprings, ie in time the future generations may face a multitude of disabilities due to incest.

Genetic defects in the off-spring of incest couplings. 

For parent-child relationships, there is also a severe imbalance of power making it more likely for the child to be unable to fully and freely consent to the relationship. 



Well there's also the *other* old argument about to what extent should a secular society take into account moral positions based on religion for the purpose of law making. For example, should we consider pork being haram in our laws on pork? 



This would be simply shifting the question of what is immoral, to what is deviant (and warrants legal prohibition).

Forum: Ensure content of Pink Dot live stream is suitable for children,WoodenSwordsman,"You've made a common mistake regarding normative claims, because the value judgement made is on asking for the equal application of censorship law.

Your error is in wrongly assuming a moral claim, i.e. that i personally support censoring the livestream, despite clear contextual language indicating otherwise (tbf, unfortunately, bigoted etc)

Normative claims are not necessarily moral claims, so I have no idea where you are trying to go with this. I am merely pointing out that you are taking a normative position, rather than simply making a descriptive comment. You were making a normative statement that laws should be applied consistently. This renders your ""*I'm not asking for anything my presumptuous guy""* either contradictory or absurd. Hence my point - own the argument that you are making. 

Since you have clarified that you are indeed making a point about consistency though, I find it much more interesting to deal with the substantive argument. 

I'm going to iron man your argument here and help you assume that the Broadcasting Act is applicable to Pink Dot, and the Internet Code of Practice is also directly applicable to Pink Dot. I'll just point out that this position is changed from your original point about ratings, since the Code has no provision for ratings like R 21. The issue is much narrower - if something is prohibited material, then it should be taken down.

So what does this code of practice say?


It is important to note that (e) is not an example of what is prohibited material. (e) is only a factor that should be taken into consideration in considering what is a prohibited material. 

It is also important to note that the final decision maker under the rules is IMDA 

(4) above really answers the issue that you are posing - namely why is IMDA not enforcing the Code consistently. The strait forward answer is IMDA is permitted discretion in deciding what is prohibited material - advocating homosexuality is merely a factor to be taken into consideration, but not determinative. What you are calling inconsistency (""either apply censorship rules consistently, or not at all"") is actually simple IMDA exercising the discretion it has under the Act and the Code.",3,1593189233,26/6/2020 16:33,  normative claims are not necessarily moral claims so i have no idea where you are trying to go with this i am merely pointing out that you are taking a normative position rather than simply making a descriptive comment you were making a normative statement that laws should be applied consistently this renders your i am not asking for anything my presumptuous guy either contradictory or absurd hence my point  own the argument that you are making   since you have clarified that you are indeed making a point about consistency though i find it much more interesting to deal with the substantive argument   i am going to iron man your argument here and help you assume that the broadcasting act is applicable to pink dot and the internet code of practice is also directly applicable to pink dot i will just point out that this position is changed from your original point about ratings since the code has no provision for ratings like r  the issue is much narrower  if something is prohibited material then it should be taken down  so what does this code of practice say   it is important to note that e is not an example of what is prohibited material e is only a factor that should be taken into consideration in considering what is a prohibited material   it is also important to note that the final decision maker under the rules is imda    above really answers the issue that you are posing  namely why is imda not enforcing the code consistently the strait forward answer is imda is permitted discretion in deciding what is prohibited material  advocating homosexuality is merely a factor to be taken into consideration but not determinative what you are calling inconsistency either apply censorship rules consistently or not at all is actually simple imda exercising the discretion it has under the act and the code,normative claims necessarily moral claims idea trying go merely pointing taking normative position rather simply making descriptive comment making normative statement laws applied consistently renders asking anything presumptuous guy either contradictory absurd hence point argument making since clarified indeed making point consistency though find much interesting deal substantive argument going iron man argument help assume broadcasting act applicable pink dot internet code practice also directly applicable pink dot point position changed original point ratings since code provision ratings like r issue much narrower something prohibited material taken code practice say important note e example prohibited material e factor taken consideration considering prohibited material also important note final decision maker rules imda really answers issue posing namely imda enforcing code consistently strait forward answer imda permitted discretion deciding prohibited material advocating homosexuality merely factor taken consideration determinative calling inconsistency either apply censorship rules consistently actually simple imda exercising discretion act code,,Neutral,normative claims necessarily moral claims idea trying go merely pointing taking normative position rather simply making descriptive comment making normative statement laws applied consistently renders asking anything presumptuous guy either contradictory absurd hence point argument making since clarified indeed making point consistency though find much interesting deal substantive argument going iron man argument help assume broadcasting act applicable  internet code practice also directly applicable  point position changed original point ratings since code provision ratings like r issue much narrower something prohibited material taken code practice say important note e example prohibited material e factor taken consideration considering prohibited material also important note final decision maker rules imda really answers issue posing namely imda enforcing code consistently strait forward answer imda permitted discretion deciding prohibited material advocating homosexuality merely factor taken consideration determinative calling inconsistency either apply censorship rules consistently actually simple imda exercising discretion act code
Forum: Ensure content of Pink Dot live stream is suitable for children,WoodenSwordsman,"Just to clarify, my original point wasn't about ratings as you claim, it's about censorship. I haven't deviated from any position, but i can't 'own/concede' an argument you've created and attributed to me.

A normative statement is a value judgement about what should be (in this case, equal application of law), and does not automatically mean the speaker is asking for such. E.g. Saying everyone should be nicer to each other doesn't mean i'm literally asking for people to be nicer to each other.

Your assumption is based on a semantic inference that normative statements are asking for something, hence a perceived contradiction with my saying i'm not asking for anything. Still not asking for anything my guy.

On to the first point then, in the interpretation that no classification is possible, and allow or ban is the only option, then i'd argue that it should be banned. (Again, not my preference, but a position taken based on the principle of equal application of law)

Your second point, that IMDA is permitted discretion is exactly what i mean by selective application of censorship. If showing X isn't allowed in movies or tv, based on the principle that it goes against values, it also shouldn't be allowed in livestreams.

Forum: Ensure content of Pink Dot live stream is suitable for children,pingmr,"

I don't make this claim, so it is a bit rich to suggestion that I've created anything and attributed to me. The argument that which I am saying you are making is "" You were making a normative statement that laws should be applied consistently."". You have acknowledged this with "" i'm saying the government should either apply censorship rules consistently, or not at all, for this or any other particular topic. ""

I only mention ratings just to show your original post was quoting all sorts of laws that you had little idea of whether they would apply to Pink Dot.

You are actually saying ""the government should either apply censorship rules consistently, or not at all, for this or any other particular topic."". If you are unhappy with the word ""ask"" , then I really am unbothered since my point here is not premised on a particular definition of ""ask"". If you take a normative view, as you have, then defend it. If you are defending it now, then great.

Well first just as a general principle your ""position"" is not value neutral here - you are essentially saying that what you call ""equal application of law"" is more important than Pink Dot, and should thus be the overriding principle. You might not ""prefer"" this outcome, but in your view this how the rules ought to play out.

Second, I don't really think you understand the term ""equal application of law"". This principle does not preclude agencies like IMDA exercising discretion which is conferred on them by the law. Of course if IMDA is exercising discretion which it does not legally have then that's illegal. However the Act legally gives IMDA the discretion to write the Code - all sorts of laws allow for this, and it's simply an issue of practical necessity. Discretion is needed to decide on some issues because not all exigencies can be set out preemptively in the law.

Third, your point on IMDA's discretion is in any event muddled, because you are comparing the Code which is specifically for Internet Content, with movies and TVs, which are governed elsewhere. So this isn't an issue of rules being applied inconsistently - it's different rules applying to different situations.

Well this really just goes back to the start, really. If you think that what you think is the ""equal application of law"" ought to apply to PD and hence ban the live stream, then that's the position you are saying should happen. 

There is some irony here since you only go so far as to say that all LGBT content should be censored equally, but seem to stop there. Absent are the very issues that PD exists to address - equality before the law for LGBT people. The shortsighted view you are offering here is that we should apply a bad law equally, with will have the practical effect of suppressing efforts to remove that bad law.

Forum: Ensure content of Pink Dot live stream is suitable for children,WoodenSwordsman,"Yes! Now we're getting somewhere. I'll go point by point.


Still a claim that you denied making. I don't know what you're so distressed about. Just own it. Ok i'm kidding here, this is a minor off rail point, i'll concede.

Here is the main difference in opinion. My position has from the start been, censor equally, or not at all, and stops there intentionally, because exemptions prolong bad laws. It reduces the urgency and need for civil action to repeal/amend said bad law, because it reduces the adverse effects felt.

Just like with 377a not being enforced, exemption for PD live stream, and even the start of PD in sg is in my opiniona short sighted respite for affected parties, because it provides an outlet, an overflow valve, for invested stakeholders to gather without infringing on the public consciousness. The rest of the year the bad laws are still in place but civil activism is relegated to an apportioned place and time, and can be safely ignored or downplayed because ""it's not enforced what"" or ""we celebrate PD every year"".

I'd argue, that applying the bad law equally would counter intuitively have the effect of galvanizing said stakeholders into greater action, to achieve the critical mass needed to influence policy makers, rather than result in suppressing efforts to remove that bad law.

Of course, this doesn't factor in the utility of PD/livestream to existing lgbt people, the confidence, comfort or camaraderie they can draw from it. So it basically boils down to a choice of slow and steady with a chance of never, or ripping off a band-aid that may or may not work either.

Re unaddressed x2


Equal application of law does not preclude IMDA's discretion, conferred by law, as it isn't an issue of rules being applied inconsistently, it's different rules applying to different situations, is what you're saying.

It follows, that if it has been deemed not inconsistent, every exercise of the same discretionary power is a valid instance of equal application of law.

My point is that all these different laws are derived from the same (in this case, bad) principle, to avoid depictions of lgbt in media, consistently applied across films, tv, books, where the same principle applied to livestreams is equally valid and, if consistently applied, should result in the same outcome.

If we look at the laws they are quoting: 


Internet Code of Practice


They say

4(2) In considering what is prohibited material, the following factors should be taken into account: -
(e) whether the material advocates homosexuality or lesbianism, or depicts or promotes incest, paedophilia, bestiality and necrophilia


But look at the next line

4(3) A further consideration is whether the material has intrinsic medical, scientific, artistic or educational value.



IMDA Arts Entertainment Classification Code 


They say

I(5)b. Social Norms
Prevailing social norms, which are norms accepted by a majority of the community at a given point in time, should be recognised. The portrayal of non-mainstream lifestyles and behaviours should typically be accompanied by at least consumer advice. This includes, but is not limited to, alternative sexualities, fetishes and addictions.

"âProtect our kids from homosexual contentâ â Over 27,000 parents ask the government to censor Pink Dot livestream",Boogie_p0p,"Sorry but while it may appear there is logical consistency at first glance, you will find that there is still no logical consistency once you dig deeper into the methods that this petition calls for. Let me break it down for you. I will not be talking about the veracity of whether homosexuality is a choice or not because it's out of scope and the ppl you've interacted with probably thinks it's a choice by default anyways.

---------

Premise: Ppl believe homosexuality is a choice. You can just pick and choose who you're sexually and romantically attracted to any time, any day. We can further extrapolate that to ***""changing sexual orientation is possible if you just make up your mind on it.""***

By that logic, pinkdot don't need to be ban **even if** teenagers are known to be easily influenced by things around them because they can just ***choose*** not participate in homosexual activities - just like how there are plenty of teenagers who ***choose*** not to smoke or do tidepod challenge, or any other kind of vices even after being exposed to such info. In fact, there's also no virtue to banning it because: 

* a) teenagers who are interested will seek it out regardless of the medium in which the information exist in (internet, books, school sex ed, friend etc)
* b) teenagers with anti-establishment streak will actively seek out such material by sheer virtue that it's something their parental figure *do not* want them to see. 

To counter (a), the banning of pinkdot will not even be remotely effective as there are plenty of lgbt materials on the internet, some even more explicit than just words and pink lights.

To counter (b), the banning of pinkdot also wouldn't even be remotely effective either as the taboo nature of the material makes those teens even more curious about it, further increasing their chances of being influenced by it. So this is not only ineffective but may even end up being counterproductive.

Therefore the logically consistent choice here would be to provide the teenagers with the necessary materials to make an informed choice (i.e making up their minds) rather than banning it and pretending it doesn't exist.",2,1592916083,23/6/2020 12:41,sorry but while it may appear there is logical consistency at first glance you will find that there is still no logical consistency once you dig deeper into the methods that this petition calls for let me break it down for you i will not be talking about the veracity of whether homosexuality is a choice or not because it is out of scope and the ppl you have interacted with probably thinks it is a choice by default anyways    premise ppl believe homosexuality is a choice you can just pick and choose who you are sexually and romantically attracted to any time any day we can further extrapolate that to changing sexual orientation is possible if you just make up your mind on it  by that logic pinkdot do not need to be ban even if teenagers are known to be easily influenced by things around them because they can just choose not participate in homosexual activities  just like how there are plenty of teenagers who choose not to smoke or do tidepod challenge or any other kind of vices even after being exposed to such info in fact there is also no virtue to banning it because    a teenagers who are interested will seek it out regardless of the medium in which the information exist in internet books school sex ed friend etc  b teenagers with antiestablishment streak will actively seek out such material by sheer virtue that it is something their parental figure do not want them to see   to counter a the banning of pinkdot will not even be remotely effective as there are plenty of lgbt materials on the internet some even more explicit than just words and pink lights  to counter b the banning of pinkdot also would not even be remotely effective either as the taboo nature of the material makes those teens even more curious about it further increasing their chances of being influenced by it so this is not only ineffective but may even end up being counterproductive  therefore the logically consistent choice here would be to provide the teenagers with the necessary materials to make an informed choice ie making up their minds rather than banning it and pretending it does not exist,sorry may appear logical consistency first glance find still logical consistency dig deeper methods petition calls let break talking veracity whether homosexuality choice scope ppl interacted probably thinks choice default anyways premise ppl believe homosexuality choice pick choose sexually romantically attracted time day extrapolate changing sexual orientation possible make mind logic pinkdot need ban even teenagers known easily influenced things around choose participate homosexual activities like plenty teenagers choose smoke tidepod challenge kind vices even exposed info fact also virtue banning teenagers interested seek regardless medium information exist internet books school sex ed friend etc b teenagers antiestablishment streak actively seek material sheer virtue something parental figure want see counter banning pinkdot even remotely effective plenty lgbt materials internet even explicit words pink lights counter b banning pinkdot also would even remotely effective either taboo nature material makes teens even curious increasing chances influenced ineffective may even end counterproductive therefore logically consistent choice would provide teenagers necessary materials make informed choice ie making minds rather banning pretending exist,,Neutral,sorry may appear logical consistency first glance find still logical consistency dig deeper methods petition calls let break talking veracity whether homosexuality choice scope ppl interacted probably thinks choice default anyways premise ppl believe homosexuality choice pick choose sexually romantically attracted time day extrapolate changing sexual orientation possible make mind logic  need ban even teenagers known easily influenced things around choose participate homosexual activities like plenty teenagers choose smoke tidepod challenge kind vices even exposed info fact also virtue banning teenagers interested seek regardless medium information exist internet books school sex ed friend etc b teenagers antiestablishment streak actively seek material sheer virtue something parental figure want see counter banning  even remotely effective plenty  materials internet even explicit words pink lights counter b banning  also would even remotely effective either taboo nature material makes teens even curious increasing chances influenced ineffective may even end counterproductive therefore logically consistent choice would provide teenagers necessary materials make informed choice ie making minds rather banning pretending exist

Although earlier in the interview he was like ""I'm no longer in charge, I can only express a personal view"" (regarding single mothers). So that's the deflection for why anything he's saying isn't pushed for in parliament I guess.

Lee Kuan Yew on Gay Rights,sec5,"We live in a snowflake society today. 

During then and in his memoirs, LKY said that there were a few times when he thought his life or career was over.

When you are willing to risk your life for what you stand for as well as am willing to deny the life and careers of others , that's what creates leaders like LKY. 

He also had the foresight to see that the united states or China would meddle and attempt to turn Singapore into another political satellite state similar to hong kong, and he pre-empted that through various mechanisms such as implementing NS, restricting western journalism, closing down chinese language schools , and even going to the united states appearing before the committees there to make his case for his actions in defending Singapores choices to exclude free (read: open to influence and biased) journalism in Singapore.

This rhymes with all the unrest in HK today, where Jimmy Lai of Apple Daily was arrested, in a society upended by political anarchy and western intervention in socio-media politics; where students grow up under a heavily politicized educational curriculum , where unregulated capitalism has resulted in socio discontent and dysfunction with unaffordable housing and living, where the media and press is sensationalized to produce a narrative that serves rhetoric and ideology rather than record and discern the truth . 

There's an interview of LKY in HK where he mentions and predicts all this as well. He was right. The man had an uncanny understanding of east and west. But look at the media today, the narrative is basically written by the west. These geopolitical truths are lost . Instead of knowing and understanding issues , issues are instead emotionalized and dramatized.

The west has effectively managed to taichi and spin it , then blame it on China ; and the young and impressionable swallow it hook , line and sinker.

To me it's really pretty much history repeating with what's happening there akin to the opium war but instead of opium, it's poisonous ideas and what is really sedition against their own society that they've used to indoctrinate young, fresh and impressionable minds. HK looks set for a few decades of lost generation or lost youth. 

It is also contrasted with Malaysias never ending racial and religious political issues that have costed her a massive loss in development potential. 

Singapores success is not a coincidence. It's intentional upon LKYs foresight and sheer genius in navigating the politics of his time. I think what falls short here is that many other neighbouring states have failed to learn and accept LKYs message, and his philosophy has not been adopted well by other countries who continue to suffer from base political and social ailments (racial issues, religious issues, factionism, weak government , strong foreign intervention, weak economy, etc)

The west has always readily used populist mob rule in the guise of democracy and human rights to destabilize and divide the east. Their goal is to ultimately remain number 1, and to rewire the world to view the west and the US as the leading model on a pedestal to be emulated , followed and for their US dollar and US culture to remain as the worlds template to function.

Anyway that is a problem I have regarding the hypocrisy among the pro-LGBT crowd in general. The whole point of the movement is to improve inclusivity of a marginalised group - but itâs so aggressive towards anyone who disagrees that it forces other groups out from the conversation. Ironically it misses the whole point LKY said in this video to *let people be*. 

The problem is that both sides take the most extreme versions of the other and paint the entire side in that light. Truelove jumped straight to calling gay people the devil, and in the thread above it jumped to insults of brainwashing. It only further divides society on the matter as grounds for rational discussion shrink, and at the end of the day no one wins. We need to move past throwing mud at each other for this conversation to make any headway in Singapore. 

Iâd say the tone is extremely different here thanks to the makeup of this subreddit being largely pro-LGBT.
